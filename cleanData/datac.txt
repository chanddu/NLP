+ this masterful piece filmmaking many themes simmering occasionally boiling warts study poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments london outward tranquillity welsh coastal retreat borderlines between friendship lust love dedication art experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice egotism versus heroism selfsacrifice more 
+ a mature subtle script suggests occasionally brings dramatic focus underlying tensions served perfect performances apart odd inappropriate smiling keira knightley prone though perhaps under direction time characters themselves often mention 
+ but above exquisite visual composition each moment inventive elegant closeup camera angle lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage wonder joy behold
