-	It's not New, it is REMANUFACTURED! . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .
+	Let's face if, everyone has heard all of the cons about the Windows 8 OS on phones, tablets, and computers alike.  I began with the Droid Global (Android OS, in case it isn't obvious), I loved it but it bogged down within a year of heavy use, the apps running in the background really do kill the phone after a while.  I switched to T-Mobile and tried the Nokia Lumia 710, I had it for a year until I recently had a biking accident and smashed the screen to pieces (RIP phone)...but that phone had Windows 7 OS and even after a year, it never "slowed down" like the iPhones and Android phones do alike.  This phone, the Nokia Lumia 521, has the Windows 8 OS (quite the upgrade from Windows 7), after just a year Nokia was able to release a product with a better OS, the Windows market is clearly expanding, and aside from the pointless cons, this phone is truly worth your money.*The "new" phone price on Amazon was half that of what the price was on the T-Mobile website. You will get absolutely the same product, but cheaper. Keep that in mind.Pros:-The ability to make tiles bigger and smaller, helping group up separate categories for apps.-It literally took me under 10 minutes to update everything on the phone, download a handful of apps that I use, syncing my contacts, these guys really do make it easy.-I don't care what people say, the app store is more than sufficient. Although Microsoft did make the mistake of getting into the market much later than the Android and iOS, they're playing catch up and giving them a run for their money. (Taking half a star off for it not being 'up to par' with everything yet, but it's still more than enough).-You can't beat the price for what you get.  An efficient phone with most of the features other modern high end phones come with, Nokia's included apps, at 1/4 the cost of these new high end phones. No flash? Oh no, I'm going to cry. *Sarcasm-It's the perfect size, but it will slip out of your hand if you're not careful: Easy fix, purchasing a $2 phone case on Amazon to give it more protection and grip.Cons:-The app store.  As explained before, it could be bigger..but it has everything you should need, and it's growing.  So, not a huge con on my end.In the end, it's an all around great phone.  Android and Apple do have their perks as well, and I can easily navigate through any of them, but Windows has provided the best experience for me so far.  It's a slight learning curve (which people are afraid of), and it won't be your "Droid Razor" or "iPhone 5", it's something different.Anyone that's going to rant, "how much did Microsoft pay you to write this review?", don't even.  I'm definitely a tech-friendly person, and this is my honest review of the product.  I've read countless reviews, and the only cons I see are simple ranting of people hate Windows 8, and if they happened to get a defective device, stuff happens, sorry to say.This is a great phone for your money, and even better saving money with T-Mobile. Windows definitely has my support.I hope this was worth the read. Have a good one.______________________________________________________________April 1st product update.After four months of medium usage, this phone is still working as well as when I've received it.  I've had more time to explore Windows and what it has to offer, Nokia keeps updates coming regularly, and I can certainly say I'm not insanely disappointed on any end.  My only drawback is seeing that a lot of companies and products are keeping away from making proper Windows applications, but it's nothing that will keep you from buying this phone if you're on a budget.  Onedrive has already done wonders for me with college, and I've received a fair amount of compliments on the phone itself.  Overall; Still a great phone, and well worth your money until you decide to upgrade to something with more features.
-	The phone is great, no doubt.The problem is that the phone  is locked to T-mobile.I bought it to use it in canada and for my vacations in the US. T-mobile refused to unlock it: you must activate the phone and be  one of their clients for several months (more than I can wait...). The Nokia Company refused to unlock it too....Expect to pay between 40 to 75 canadian dollars in Canada to get it unlocked. You may find websites that propose to unlock it for less, but no warranty on that. Finally, it took me more than 15 days to get it unlocked and the final cost was near the one I could have paid if I have bought it in canada. I should 've bought it there: less stress and efforts...
-	I went from the Windows Nokia Lumia 821 to this piece of crap!  Takes forever for the calls to go through......that's IF they go through.  Always getting cut off....dropping calls.  When on speaker it's not clear at all.  I had one week left before having to renew and it said I can only make emergency calls.  I wasted $50 for a month and hardly got to use it.  I'm going back with my VERIZON Nokia Lumia 821.  I'll be giving this phone away to someone who has a lot of patience!
-	I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan. T-Mobile informed me that this phone could be used without a data plan. The first one I purchased would not connect to my wi-fi router. It kept saying "wrong password". I also tried entering the WEP key - wouldn't work.  Also wouldn't connect to nearby open networks.  Tech support ultimately suggested that the problem might be the phone. I could easily enter my contacts into the phone and call via tower but not wi-fi.  I returned this phone and the second phone DID connect to my router - using the WEP key, not the password. However --- this phone would not let me enter any of my contacts because I had not enabled "Microsoft Contacts" (demands your phone number, email address, password, etc) and the touch screen did not work properly.  Almost had to pound on it.  However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.  But in the end, I returned it for a bad touch screen and did not try a 3rd one because I find Microsoft's demand for my personal information to be way too intrusive.  Didn't care for the Prism II android either but will keep an eye out for another reasonably priced android if they can do wi-fi calling.
+	If you are looking for a good windows phone at an affordable price, this is a good choice.  This phone came with a T-Mobile Sim card, wall charger, and, of course, the phone. I have been well pleased with the performance of the phone.
+	I wasn't sure about this phone especially when I found out that it doesn't do flash player. A lot of apps/functions I take for granted won't work here, but finding alternatives and looking forward to winphone 8.1 which I think is a free download makes it a whole lot better especially for the price which is why I went with it in the first place. It also doesn't have a front p it's also a lot stronger than it looks. The plastic case is sturdy but I added a silicone one as well for drops Really wish it had a front facing camera and a little better speakers.
-	Bank account was never credited the amount. Not happy with the return process. It takes too long. By then returning it is too late
+	got the phone a little while ago, its really nice i like it alot, ive experienced all the problems that have been mentioned on this phone ontop of accidentally frying my sd card but after that little bit of trouble i found this phone to be rather amazing its high quality and once you work out the kinks is very nice
+	My prior nokia phone died unexpectedly recently, and, out of warranty, I needed a replacement fast. I wanted to stick with Nokia, believing that getting my contacts and other data loaded into a new lumia phone would be easy using the Suite. Being a T-Mobile customer, I thought transferring my account to the new phone could be done easily online. I was wrong. Luckily, I already had an outlook mail account to turn to. After manually loading in my old contacts into that email account (2 hours), my phone was syncing and ready to make calls. Also, a relatively quick call to T-Mobile completed the account setup. I am not that excited about my contact information living 'in the cloud', but hopefully, the next time a phone dies I can recover from it more quickly. Certainly I was disappointed that, in 2013, it can still be a royal pain to manage contacts going from handset to handset. Can't all these digital systems just, get along?OK. Going from a premium Nokia handset to Nokia's cheapest offering means a loss of some features, specifications, and build quality. What I am learning, however, is that this budget phone is hardly crippled - it runs awesome. Most premium phones offer larger, better screens, better cameras, and better build materials. My last phone was metal, so pulling the 'cheap' plastic cover off the new phone was a little bit strange - so were the 'cheap' buttons. But my experience with premium devices (and I include the Nexus 7 here) has been that, even with top of the line processors, cameras, lots of RAM, etc., most do not really deliver performance and features that make upgrading an OBVIOUS choice. This phone costs 4-5 times less than Nokia's other top offering for T-Mobile, the 925, but hardly feels like a budget phone.The phone feels great in hand (a little slippery). The glass screen is great, and the buttons click and fall easily to hand. The plastic helps keep the phone light, it is still durable, and does not interfere with antennas like metal can. Having a removable cover and cheap battery easily replaceable is also a godsend considering the inconvenience of permanent batteries. There is no front-facing camera (don't care), 8 gb internal storage, 512 Ram, and a 1 ghz dual-core snapdragon processor. I threw a 16 gb card into the phone, and deleted all the pre-installed cr-apps since I knew I wouldn't use them. Contrary to what I read online, I don't see the storage or RAM limitations as a major issue - 1 gb is the upper-limit for Nokia's phones at this time, and I do not tend to heavily multi-task. Also, there may be 1 zillion apps in the world currently, but I only like a handful of them as it is. I have a tablet for more robust gaming/app needs.Despite its specs, the 521 runs great. The experience is smooth, the screen is bright and sharp (with some minimal bleed in the dark), the buttons feel good, and texting / browsing is simple and fun. The app store (like all app stores) is set up with a lot of categories, but I still find "browsing" limited - I feel like I need to know what I am looking for. But all my favorite apps were in there. The call quality is great, the speaker phone is louder and clearer than my old "premium" phone, and headphones sound great (better than my nexus 7). GPS worked fast and without hiccups when navigating. The camera is OK in good lighting, and 5 MP is still good nuff for an 8x10 assuming you get a good shot. Given that even 'premium' phone cameras still fail, in my opinion, to really replace a rudimentary point-and-shoot (especially in low-light), this is totally fine with me. There are some interesting camera apps to try out, and I'll look forward to seeing if they deliver better results (by basically doing 'burst modes').The MS Phone 8 software feels fresh, is very elegant, and really should give Apple and Android the night-sweats. But I have little doubt that it is harder to use out-of-box than iOS. That said I find it very 'premium' feeling. I love the live-tiles, customization, and overall presentation of most of its core features. I did need a couple days to learn the ins and outs a bit (at first the whole setup was confusing). There are some OS features missing that I want to see put in. Most importantly, I like Androids ability to close an open app by swiping it away, and Android and Nokia's pull down menus that let you easily turn off/on things like data, wi-fi, GPS, and Bluetooth (I am trying an app called "quick settings" which is mainly a bunch of short-cuts). Oddly, I can't seem to pick a home page in Internet explorer. Also, stock MS settings are a real battery drain - it is a good idea to read up on web tips for maximizing battery life. For starters, it is so easy to set up email accounts that I did 2 right away - then remembered I need to change the sync settings to balance update/power use. Auto-rotation is not active in all screens/apps, which is annoying when I feel like typing in landscape mode, but then again typing has been fast and accurate in portrait mode so far. There are also features on by default which are totally unneeded. Windows Phone is definitely a modern OS, and a good one at that, but it will benefit from more development. Hopefully the 8.1 update and others will hit this phone as they become available. I really hope they do, as updates are critical to keeping the experience fresh, reliable, and fun. Heck, half the reason I got a nexus was to ensure updates would be forthcoming.The most compelling reason to go Nokia is probably the free GPS + Navigation. Hands down, they are the best free solution I know of at this time, and they are exclusive to the brand. Most of Nokia's other apps are useful and add value to the overall experience. They are generally reliable phones also, and will survive drops, bumps, and a little water.The bottom line is that this phone is probably up there with the Nexus 7 in electronic super-values available at this time. Unless you have $300-500 dollars to burn, there are likely no better choices if you want an excellent smart-phone experience for a super-reasonable cost. I would gladly have paid another $100 dollars for a somewhat better screen (gorilla glass and a little higher res?), camera, more RAM, and a larger battery (and Nokia's 'altered reality' GPS app). But as is, I find no real faults here, just huge value. Buy with confidence!
+	Yes it may not have the fancy android features and apps but yes even with the 4,0 inch small screen the phone is great value for money.For anyone who is not looking for too much from the phone and is not keen on android then it is a pretty decent phone.•Fairly decent windows 8 OS with  inch WVGA LCD display•Great 5MP Camera - takes good pictures•Dual Core (1GHz) Processor•Yes you can Listen to your favorite songs with Nokia MusicI recommend this phone.
+	Amazon comes through with an amazing deal for a phone that gets the basics of a smart device, down pat.I am a T-Mobile customer who has never had an interest in breaking the bank for a cell phone. That said, I couldn't justify shopping T-Mobile's online storefront, only to find the most basic of smart phones running well over $100. So, for the first time ever, I did some shopping at Amazon to search for a phone that suits my needs without dumping loads of cash into one.Quickly, I found the Nokia Lumia 521 to be at a surprisingly great price for a phone that stakes big claims in capability. As I stated earlier, I am an existing T-Mobile customer with a plan that I had no intentions of changing. Because this purchase comes with no contract obligation, this was the perfect fit for me and any T-Mobile customer who is looking to just own a new phone.Once it arrived, the transfer from one device to the Lumia 521 was seamless. I previously owned a phone that utilized the larger SIM card; but, fortunately, the Lumia 521 included the new micro SIM card. The cost to swap SIM cards? $0. The time spent on the phone with customer service to swap SIM cards? Not a single second. Current T-Mobile users can use their TMobile.com online account access to switch SIM cards by simply typing the number supplied with the Lumia 521's SIM card! So much ease!Now, weeks later, I have used this phone for social media access, internet surfing, phone calls, text messaging and more - all with no troubles what-so-ever. Needless to say, this was exactly the phone I was looking for - it performs extremely well and at a price tag well below $100, I highly recommend this device to anyone who wants smart phone capabilities coupled with affordability.Furthermore, I should add that my previous phone was formatted with the Andriod operating system - something that I very much enjoyed. So, I was a bit apprehensive knowing that the Lumia 521 employed a Windows OS. That said, my experince with it has been nothing but positive. Only two downsides about this phone: 1) the three function keys at the bottom of the device do not light up, 2) this device, in order to cut expenses, does not have a compass (it does feature GPS, however) that would be useful with some navigation applications. Other than those findings, navigation is a breeze, customizing the tile layout is superb, and the phone processes actions with very little effort.Additionally: the screen is nicely lit, the battery has a good lifecycle, and the phone sports the level of sleekness reminiscent of its more expensive Nokia family members.Overall, this phone and the Amazon discount offer the best bang for the buck - that I am aware of - in this day and age of cell phones! If you are a current or prospective T-Mobile customer and would like to save some serious cash without comprimising quality, look no further than the Lumia 521.
+	Good for basic smartphone things like email, internet, Twitter, and FB if you're into that. It doesn't have apps as good as Android or iOS. But for $69 I can't complain too much. *whisper* Buy this phone from Microsoft's website, it's cheaper than Amazon. Ahem, the battery life is good if you don't have cellular data turned on. It lasted 36 hours easily with light usage. I don't have a data plan so I don't know how long the phone would last with it turned on. One thing that bothered me is that the battery was really hard to remove when I had to slide my SIM card in. This phone will get an upgrade to WIndows phone 8.1 this summer with the personal assistant feature, so yay!
+	I have have used many difference type of devices. Iphones, Ipads, Ipods, Kindle Fires, etc.. For the money, the Nokia Lumia is fantastic. I mean it compares or is even better to me than the Iphone or Samsung devices. The great things that I like.1) I never thought I say this but Windows 8 is better and easier to use than any Apple product I have used. 521 is very easy to get up and running and it seems like they setup the phone with what I would say 95% of the time most people want out of a phone. Window 8 is smooth and easy to find your way around.2) Has all the apps that I want. I am not a big gammer so if you are, Apple or Samsung products do have more. I guess since so new the programmers need to catch up for Windows 8. Still, tons of apps to use.3) I like the size of the 521 and case. To me, I do not even need a case.4) Price, for all that is has. Cannot beat the price.Things I would not mind being different on it.1) Game apps. really only thing that it needs to catch up on compared to Apple.2) Camera flash, most of the time you do not need a flash. I am sure when Nokia was deciding on the price point flash was taken out since 90 plus % of the time you do not use it. A flash would come in handy however.All in all. I am going to keep buying Nokia Windows 8 phones.
-	First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film. Obviously, it's not a new phone, it's been used and returned.Second, it can not turn off. After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black. But after 1 second, it automaticallyturn back on. I've tried couple times. There's no chance to turn it off. Have to take out the battery to shut it down.Request a replacement within the first half hour after i receive the package.Hope the seller would send me a real BRAND NEW phone.
+	Order this as a replacement phone for T-Mobile. It is a locked phone, but T-Mobile will unlock after 6 month.  This is a good solid phone if you do not want an iPhone.  Easy to use, large viewing touch pad, free music and it is very intuitive.Have bought more expensive phones that was not this nice.
+	I bought a couple of these for my kids. They have WIFI calling and when logged into the WIFI you can use them just like a land line even in schools where cell service is non-existant due to thick walls.
+	My wife's Lumia 721 developed a problem with the charging port just before we were leaving for Europe so I got one of these for her while I sent the 721 for repair. (The 721 was back before we were, no charge. Just use the Nokia site.)Got it in two days using Amazon Prime for over double the current price but don't regret it. We had very limited data in Europe but that did not detract from the main use: Nokia Drive+ and Here maps. Drive+ lets you download the maps you need so you don't need a data connection to use it. The only drawback that we didn't know about is that you have to buy a $20 license for Drive if you use it outside the country where it is registered. Try to do that before you need it if data or wifi is limited. But after getting the license, drive and maps worked great.Another advantage of the Windows Phone 8 version is that you can go to here.com, a mapping site run by Nokia. You can find places and add them to collections which then will show up as favorites on Nokia Drive and maps on the phone automatically as long as you use the same Microsoft account for both the web and phone. Pretty cool. So, I could plan our trip ahead and add locations we wanted to visit, or hotels and didn't have to add them manually on the phone.As a phone, it works great. Wifi and bluetooth are fine. Has built in FM if you use wired earphones.About the only slight drawback is that the screen is not gorilla glass and doesn't have Nokia's Tru-Black screen tech that makes most of its other phones readable in sunlight. But, there have to be some compromises to get so much in one package for the price.Highly recommended.
-	This shouldn't even get a rating. When i ask if it went well with T-Mobile service .well lets just say i was not satisfied at all .the language on the phone is not English.
+	This phone fits my needs.  It looks nice and for the price and can do a lot!  I would recommend this phone.
+	Amazing phone for the price. Never lags or randomly shuts off/glitches or anything. Very good camera too. Windows 8 takes a little getting used to but it runs flawlessly on this phone. Very good battery life too.  Never gets hot with constant use like some other phones. Too bad I also just bought an iPhone because I would have saved my money and bought another one of these instead had I known how durable and well built these are. This nokia was a present for my boyfriend. This phone feels like it could have easily been sold for $500 instead of $119 lol.
-	This phone worked for 1 Day and then died, it no longer takes a charge – I am extremely dissatisfied with this service and would not recommend purchasing.I bought this phone as a replacement for my son in college when he returned home for the Easter holiday weekend. He called the phone company to activate phone on Friday night and by Saturday afternoon the phone was no longer working.He ended up going back to school without a phone which is exactly what I was trying to avoid.
-	The ad does not suggest that this phone can only be registered in australia and if you use it in US you would receive no authorised customer service.So if anything goes wrong with the phone after you purchase there would be no place where you can get it service here in the US.The ad does not mention this.Then if you return it you are charged a minimum of 15% stocking fee.This is fraud.
-	this phone was horribleconsno music could go in to the phonemessaging took forever and most of the time it said failedcould only bluetooth contactsinternet is slowhardly any memorypictures cant be posted on any mobile sitesno videos on youtube or any other siteno camcorderno headphone jack only a tiny one for mini antennasthe keys on the keyboard are all smudged togetherand moreprosit has alright calling quality
+	I love this phone.  I would buy another one in the future... the features are nice..... better than other smartphones I've had.
-	It is labeled as New, but the seal were broken. Where is was supposed to be closed and be opened and the final user be able to open it, I checked the phone if any scratches or anything. Everything looks great so far, I hope the warehouse amazon people stop messing around with the products before ship it to the end user.ThanksHopefully the phone will be working if not some action has to be taken.
-	Doesn't even deserve a one star... Sorry but worst phone in the world. My boyfriend and I both ordered phones and they both started to glitch in the first couple of weeks. Plus all the covers we ordered for it didn't for right
+	The Lumia 520/521 is by far the best value in a smartphone.  The build quality, features and design of this phone is really hard to beat, and at this price point maybe impossible to beat.I have owned high-end Lumia 920 and 820 devices, and while they have better glass, higher resolution screens and more storage, this 521 provides 90% of the Windows Phone experience at 20% of the price.  It runs virtually all Winows Phone apps, and unlike the higher end devices has a user-accessible battery and Micro SD card slot.If money is not an issue, the higher-end Lumia phones are technically superior, but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a smartphone who cares about value for dollar spent--this is the leader in that area by a mile.
-	only had for month and half and wont turn on nothing.only has 30 day warranty :{ very disappointed.had issues from get go.......
-	I don't want to sound extremely terrible, but this phone is just awful. When I tried setting up the phone, it took nearly 2 hours to even get it to read the SIM card. Then, the headphones were broke--the sound only came in clear if you held the button down on the headphones. Internet connection and messaging were here and there (but mostly "there"), and the sound wasn't very clear when you used the phone on speaker. Another thing with the messaging is that it was pretty slow and the "space" key didn't want to work. I'd write out a whole sentence to find it read "Idk why that wouldnamdvthat because there professions" when I intended on typing "Idk why they would do that because they're professionals." Also, the size was a problem for me. A lot of people can handle big phones, but this felt like I was holding a tablet to my head when I was on the phone. In the end, I returned the phone and now I'm just waiting for my refund.
-	I received the phone and everything seemed fine, until i noticed the 'Orange' at the bottom right of the box at the network provider. European phones don't work in the U.S. for whatever reason, even unlocked, and so I've returned mine and am ordering another one. I'm just not going to order it from The Wireless Circle again, as it seems I'm not the only one who had this happen.
+	I'm not big on fancy or high-end electronics so I just wanted a decent phone at a decent price. Considering the ridiculous amount of the standard smart phone these days this seemed like a reasonable price and the average review of the phone was inspiring. I've had the phone a little over four months and I am beyond happy with it. It is more sophisticated than I expected and has a few extra features I really did not expect. Apparently it has capability to write a word document and draft an excel sheet. It also has a cool camera alternative to the standard where it takes a few shots one right after the other and shows you the best picture taken. Over all I am a happy camper. The phone I bought before this one was a little more expensive and did not compare.
+	Replacement phone for the one that got stolen. Works great, pretty simple, has most of what my old phone did and currently doesn't overheat.
-	crappy phone, bought it with a 2 year contract, used it for one day. me and my wife got tired of saying huh and what ,gave it back and got the rugby 3
+	I bought myself this phone for Christmas. It's a beaut. Setup was quick and intuitive, activation was free, and despite the limited availability of apps compared to Droid or iPhone, so far I haven't had trouble finding anything I want. As a reluctant newcomer to the smartphone scene, I'm sold.Windows phone OS is gorgeous. Everything works like I would want it to. All my inboxes are in the same place: so convenient. Despite the reviews complaining about screen resolution, my 20/15 vision can't detect any inferiority whatsoever. YouTube videos play flawlessly on the WiFi, which is very fast. In short, I love the phone, I love that it was only a hundred dollars, and I have nothing bad to say about it.
-	I bought this phone 1 year ago and paid almost 600 dollars for (incl s&h;). I had really hight expectation, specially be cause I've always had a Sony Ericsson, and they're known for their great camera phones! Boy was I wrong!! Ever since I got this phone it was reacting really slow. There's always a problem going on with this phone. Its either freezing or restarting automatically. And there's the issue with the phone having a hard time connecting to the memory card. And if you take picture, you can't save it to the memory card, it can only be saved to the phone memory (which holds like 10 pictures!). And I was expecting decent photo's with the 8mp Flash camera.. well guess what; It takes FOR EVER before a picture is taken, and its always blurry!! And the flash is supposed to be useful when taking pictures at night.. well it isn't! Unless you're taking a close up picture of your own face, the flash has no use at all!!THE CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE A STABILIZER!!If you're having an emergency and you need to call 911 or get a hold of someone, Let me warn you; YOU WON'T MAKE IT!! it takes forever with this phone to get to the dial menu and call! (that IFFF it doesnt freeze!) And even when you receive calls, you gotta giv it a sec or 2 before you hear a voice!The alarm clock is completly useless!! Why put it in there if it doesnt work?? Not that you can use your own music to wake up to it.. it doesn't matter because when you wake up in the morning (and you're late) you look at your phone (which is on your night stand) and see THAT ITS OFF !! yes it just randomly do that! When the phone handle an app or doesnt respond to the alarm, it just shuts off!All the above are just SOME of the issues that this phone has.The only PRO i can give this phone is the keyboard!The keyboard is nice and smooth, very ideal for chatting/Im/txting or even writing in the MicroSoft Office Document!Because this phone is not on the market in the states, I had orderd mine online and couldn't get a lot of review about it.It was brand new, not refurbished or used! Yet it had all these issues. im very dissapointed..
-	Because the case didn't fit my phone. I'm not sure why because I have a nokia lumia 521 and that what kind of case it was but didn't fit.
-	It's a great phone, but AT&T; phones apparently can't update or something, I don't know.I've had so many problems with it.
-	DON'T BUY IT !!!! IT REALLY SUCKS !!!! super super slow. window is loading forever...... the alarm clock is unreliable... you know there are a lot to be blamed. BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT !! I AM SERIOUS !!!
-	Phone keeps shutting off, even after battery is fully charged.  This is my 2nd phone.  I had to return the 1st one due to camera button not working!!!!  I ordered 2 of these phones and so far the other phone is working just fine.  Bad Luck???? Not sure if i should have it repaired or just look into another brand.  Frustrated.........
+	it looks and feels great, its skinny and lightweight, alot of cool options and other stuff, the camera is pretty good with focus and flash and not too expensive like a smartphone
-	Dear Jupiter Sellers,I purchased this phone from you from US Amazon in April 2013. The Amazon description did not explain that it's an international phone with NO US WARRANTY that can only be serviced by a UK Samsung Center. This is deceptive; if you are going to sell phones to US customers, you should explain if they do not have a US warranty. The SIM tray just broke and the phone is not working. Samsung is requiring me to call their UK service center to arrange for service. However because I do not have a working phone, I cannot make an international call! They do not give an option to arrange for this service over email or calling a US affiliate.I would be grateful if you could please contact me to offer to call Samsung UK at 0121 643 7373 to book this purchase for repair, in which case I would delete this negative review.
+	I recently purchased the lumia 521 after a not so good sales experience I sat wondering if I had made a mistake. As I began to explore the phone I realized for the money I had found a functional product with extras that the android phones are charging for are free. Such as you can find your phone ,you can ring your phone,you can delete info on your phone all through windows on your pc. You also can use your phone as a mini projector that's just a few extras. The all around functionality is wonderful my girlfriend has a I phone she loves it but the picture are crap really crap with my 521 I was Amazed by the picture quality great stuff those are just a few gems I discovered I could tell you more but that would spoil the fun. Hats off Microsoft you got a winner  Splice99.....
+	This phone is fantastic especially for what you're paying for. You can easily find this little gem for about $100 if not cheaper. And the best part, is it doesn't requite a contract. I've had the phone for a little over a month now, and I don't have a single complaint for it yet. The windows 8 operating system is highly customizable and easy to get used to. The calling is incredibly clear, and the app selection is decent for an operating system this new.Highly recommended if you're looking for a good phone on a tight budget.
+	I ordered 2 on accident because I was making the purchase on through an app so I received 2 phones. I explained to them and gave me a full refund, very understanding customer service. The phone we kept works good. Although, one problem is the camera...whenever it takes a picture, the whole screen starts shifting and flashing awkwardly, which isn't normal. I guess we picked one up with a glitch. Although everything else in the phone works fine.
-	I've had the GT-N7100 (international version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2) since the end of last November and for awhile I was really happy with it. Great screen, nice interaction, nice features, etc - until it just randomly stopped working one day. I was using it, then when I went to turn on the screen the next time, it just would not turn on and no sign of life except for a slowly flashing red LED. After doing some online search, I then discovered that this was apparently a common problem on the note 2 and, it would appear, also on the s3. I've NEVER had a phone (or any other electronic device, for that matter) die and not turn on again out of the blue, no warning or indication of problems whatsoever. I've tried all sorts of fixes suggested by different online forums, but no luck (I am an electrical engineer by training and know a few things about electronics... and no, I had not rooted the phone or done anything unusual to it.) Now I have a $600 brick!This, by itself, negates any positives of the phone. To top it off - Samsung does NOT service non-US versions of the phone in the US. I must contact a UK service support tech (on my own dime, and being 8 hours ahead of my time, does not give me a lot of call window) to see if they can do something with it. That pretty much means most of the unlocked Galaxy Note 2s you get in the US cannot be serviced in the US. Oh, and the 2 US service support techs I spoke with basically didn't care.This support policy by Samsung is pathetic and unacceptable, especially in view of how much they charge for these things! I will never buy another Samsung again, that is for sure!
+	This is a Great phone for the price! It is a great updated smartphone with access to all the apps I love.
-	This is not what i expected.not happy there is no memory on the phone,all thwm stupid apps they got on here,wont use any of them,but im stuck with them cause you cant delete them
+	First thing you have to do is that you have to avoid comparing this smartphone with higher end devices such as the Galaxy S4, HTC One, Iphone, or other Nokia Lumia devices. If you are considering this phone is likely you are trying to purchase a budget smartphone for you or someone else. I can honestly say this device looks and feels better than its price (expect to pay around $100 or less at Amazon).The screen looks nice, it is responsive and fast for a budget device, and it's easy to use. I bought this as a gift and it is the first time I use a Windows device since my experience has been with Android and Apple iOS (iPhone), and i love to learn and experience with gadgets and especially smartphones, and I can truly say the experience with Windows in this device has been positive so far, so if you are planning on getting this for people not used to handling smartphones I think it would be easy for them to learn the basics (making calls, checking voicemail, reading and writing emails and SMS, browsing the internet, etc). The only drawback so far has been the battery which is not awful, but could be better as it is the case with many smartphones out there, even high end devices.Once again, understand this is a budget phone so do not expect the best pictures, the fastest phone, largest memory or hard drive, or LTE connectivity. If you need any of this, look somewhere else and expect to pay a higher price for these features, but if they are not a deal breaker then consider this device.I will provide an update later if necessary, and also recommend checking the Moto G which in my opinion is the best budget device but it costs more at $179 (8GB) or $199 (16GB) depending on the model. Both are available at Amazon, and can be customized with back covers at an additional cost. So, if you are looking for the best $100 or less smartphone, get the Nokia Lumia 521, but if you are looking for the best device under $200 I strongly recommend the Moto G.
+	I'm glad I didn't get sucked in to a $600 plus smart phone.  This little Nokia  512 is one of the neatest gadgets I have, and believe me, I'm a gadget hound.  $99 was a good price, as they sell for $149 plus tax at T-Mobile, so I saved at least $50.  Love the Nokia Lumia 512!
-	Limited options to control its features, whenever you trying something bing pop up on your face veryfrequently.Limited options to control the features and limited options on the settingsvery hard to control it , if you connect to wifi and not using it for few mins it immediately goes offlineonce you starting using it , you feel very much trappedI will definitely return back if I can get a refund
-	I really loved the look of this phone, and the price couldn't be beat. After getting the phone, I put my new sim card in for use with Straight Talk. Phone is activated, internet works, but no text messaging. Day 2, APN is wiped out because the phone has stopped recognizing the sim card. So now, no internet but having text messaging. Later on Day 2, phone has no service as the sim card is not detected at all.Bottom line, avoid this product. Price does not = value.
-	First time around I bought this phone on random selection for the Seller. According to the title of this phone it's Factory Unlocked, it is not specified as an international model in the title or the description. Only way to know that it is international is by researching the model number or looking more closely at what each individual seller description is.The first phone I got was from FGS Trading, I didn't know it was international until after I received the phone and when it turned on, it was in Mandarin. I had to google and youtube a video in order to walk me through setting the phone into English, imagine the hassle. I contacted this Seller about the issue, also that the phone was not syncing with my computer because the ID Hardware was not identifiable. The Seller refused to take back the phone without charging me extra and finally after almost 2 months of debating the issue with the seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z Claim I ended up getting a full refund. Tom is the name of the customer service agent from FGS who I spoke to and demonstrated over the exchange of 30 + emails that he clearly is not fit for customer service. For him, his company is always right and I was the airhead who didn't do my research into this phone.THE SELLER does not follow their 100% money back guarantee unless they are forced to and their customer service is lacking, if they were competent it would not have taken nearly 2 months to resolve the issue. This seller also does not offer return labels for the assurance that an item can be shipped back to them, they only provide an address. You have to pay for your own shipping, insurance and signature on the package just to make sure the Seller gets back their phone. **Buyer beware, if you purchase an international model SAMSUNG USA will not cover this phone under their warranties. In order for me to get any service on this phone I would have had to send it all the way back to Hong Kong. The Seller does not provide you with this information. All they cared about and clearly demonstrated was that they got their money so they no longer need you or positive feedback. In one of the email exchanges from the Sellers' agent, he told me that MOST CONSUMERS KNOW this phone is international and that they are happy with the phone they received and since I am unhappy/unsatisfied/clueless its my own fault because I did not do my research. Does that mean that those who posted similar reviews are clueless as well??? :(Now here's the kicker, I re-purchased this phone because I have wanted it for a really long time, BUT since I did not want to run into the same problem, I did my purchase with Amazon customer service on the phone.  Now, the Amazon agent was not aware that this phone was international either. World Wide Distribuitors did not have it labeled or specified as an international phone. I re-bought the phone only because it was assumed to be US Coded. The Amazon agent advised me that it was, otherwise the Seller must disclose that it is international.BOY!! were we wrong... I did not find out this phone was international until it was already in transit to me. The seller finally responded to my inquires 3 days after I made my purchase to inform me it was international. I immediately contacted the Seller by phone and the customer service person- Juan, who I spoke to was very nice. He told me to simply refuse the package. Aslong as the item remained unopened/unused and still in its original factory shipped form I would get a full refund.I followed his instructions and anticipated a full refund minus the shipping fee I paid. That did not happen. Upon my second phone contact with the seller, the first agent was not helpful, he informed me that I was subject to a restocking and a return shipping fee. At this point I requested to speak to a supervisor to justify why I was receiving two sets of information and how it was even LEGAL for the Seller to charge those fees.The supervisors name was Melissa, she was definatley NOT helpful. In fact, this person was unprofessional, rude and very condescending. Melissa informed me 1) my product was subject to a restocking fee and since the item was returned I would have to pay for that cost as well, 2) I could not contest it because it was a company policy clearly listed on Amazon's website and 3) Even if I filed an A-to-Z claim it would be denied immediately because the policies they have are all Amazon pre-approved. This person was snarky, rude and beyond tolerable. Melissa even refused to give me any company information in order to file a BBB claim. When I told them I would take the matter back to Amazon, she told me she would be happy to transfer me to Amazon customer service so that I can hear Amazon tell me that my refund request would be denied since I obviously needed to hear it from two sources.Two weeks have gone by since my purchase from World Wide and Amazon granted me a full refund since I refused this package. Amazon also gave me a promotional gift in the amount of the original shipping fee for the trouble I have encountered with the Seller. I have also submitted a BBB claim against this Seller and my complaint can be viewed publicly. So I suppose, in the end, Melissa, if you see this post, you were wrong.It's a shame really. I have wanted this phone for a long time and finally saved up enough to get it. Times are hard, cash is not expendable for most consumers and this purchase was a luxury item purchase for me. I never expected to get so much trouble. When I did have the phone, it was a wonderful experience since I had never had something before that could do so much. It played movies, music, took wonderful pictures, writing instead of using the qwerty board to text was awesome. I really love this phone but I will not sign a contract to have it :(.... Too bad that all the factory unlocked are international models.
+	I'd been in the market for a new, relatively inexpensive phone.  I'd seen the Nokia Lumia 521 here and there and really just dismissed it as an Android wanna-be. The price is crazy cheap, so I figured it must be 'low-end'. And, you know, the app store is so SMALL!  People, step outside the Android/iphone box and give this phone a try. It is just so neat!  It's innovative, it's different, it's pretty (in a generic sense :)), the screen is not too small, not too big, feels good in the hand, the images are bright and rich, the 'live' tiles are cool and the phone is just overall fun! Have a read of some of the reviews for specifics.  I LOVE this phone and can't imagine who wouldn't.
-	I Bought this phone for it to suddenly stop working with no warning. turns out the motherboard completely died on me.Good Luck getting anywhere with customer service. The US Samsung CS turned me down saying this is a UK phone. UK tells me this phone is made in the UAE, and UAE tells me that the phone is manufactured in Africa so they can't do anything. I got no where and ended up with > 600$ down the drain.Beware of this Seller and Beware of Samsung Products.
-	Had my Note two less than 1.5 years and already the USB port is broken.  $300 phone on contract and they use crap cheap parts to make these things and it's only a matter of time before it won't work any more.  Plastic piece of useless crap
-	I will never buy from this place again.Bought a phone and tried to connect and the phone carrier said they couldn't connect it and who ever I bought it from knew it couldn't be hooked up!!!Very disappointed in my purchace!The time and effort going to my phone company just for them to say they couldn't do it was embarrassing!
+	Yes, the Lumia 520 / 521 is (by a large margin) the device that has put Windows Phone in the hands of more people than any other device. That's because with Windows Phone the experience is pretty much the same across all devices (aside from hardware). That means that whether you pay $100 for the 521 or $700 for the top-of-the-line Lumia 1020, you get the same features in your day-to-day experience. This automatically makes a lower-end device like this T-Mobile phone an attractive deal.That being said, what you are NOT getting in the 521 is a bright screen, LTE high-speed data, and a great camera. If you can make that trade-off (and obviously millions of people can), then this a great deal.A note on the lack of LTE - T-Mobile's non-LTE 4G service is VERY fast. So the lack of LTE is not as big a sacrifice as it would be if you are on, say, Sprint or Verizon (where the non-LTE data rates are horrible).In addition there are two hardware advantages of the 521 that are worth noting.  * It feels great in the hand - not too big, quite thin and light. You'll forget it is even in your pocket.  * It does WiFi calling. Even if you are in a building that has lousy T-Mobile cell reception, if you are connected to WiFi then the phone will send / receive calls using your in-house network instead. This can be a huge plus. For example, in my apartment I am on a side of the building that gets iffy reception in some rooms. With this feature, that is no longer an issue. All my calls go through the my WiFi router and are crystal clear. Only T-Mobile has this service, and not all TMo phones can do it. This one can.Weigh these advantages against:  * Photos are average for a smartphone camera. (Ok, maybe slightly above average.)  * There is no flash. Mostly I miss this because I can't use a flashlight app to help pick up dog poop in the dark.  * While adding an SD card will let you load tons of music, video, etc - there is limited memory space for apps. Many will never notice this, but if you want to load a lot of games, you may hit that ceiling.  * The screen is OK - but not great in sunlight and not the kind of HD resolution we are becoming used to.  * For a phone with a 4" screen, it is not exactly small. As a matter of fact I put it next to my Moto X (with a 4.7" screen) and they are almost exactly the same size. It's not huge, by any measure, but don't expect an iPhone sized device just because it has a smaller screen.In short, it is pretty good value for money and perfect if you want to give Windows Phone a try, or need a second phone on a cheap plan. If you need more network speed or a better camera, then the Lumia 925 (on T-Mobile) or Lumia 1020 (on At&T;) will make you VERY happy - but they will cost 6 or 7 times as much.***Update 2-14-2014I've gotta share this. Last week my Lumia went through the wash AND the dryer before I found the phone, back cover, and battery mixed in with clothes. My heart sank. I put it on the dresser and just left it for a week, and put the SIM in another backup phone.Today I put the SIM back in and turned it on... and it's working just fine! Kind of unbelieveable. This is a tough little guy.*** New to Windows Phone? ***Let's get some of these basic questions out of the way:Why is the processor / memory specs so low?Windows Phone is a light operating system that doesn't require much hardware to run well. The real question is: how fast does it run? The answer is very fast; very responsive. This is just as zippy as Nokia's top-of-the-line Lumia 1020 when it comes to everyday tasks. You won't see any lag until you run graphic-intensive games or photo editing.Why can't I customize the background like in Android / iOS?Because there is no background. The Windows Phone screen uses tiles, not app icons. Many tiles are "live", which mean that they show you information without having to actually open up the app. For example, weather alerts, new email or voice message, what someone has just posted on facebook or twitter. You can resize and arrange the tiles, and actually get quite fancy and graphically interesting, if you want. (See my pics.)http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1OZRLSQTX4G7Q/B00COYOAYW/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1OZRLSQTX4G7Q/B00COYOAYW/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkIs there an app for Facebook? Dropbox? Twitter? Instagram?...etcIf you mean an "official" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no. If you mean can I do Facebook; acccess my Dropbox files; do Twitter; post, search, or browse instagram - then the answer is almost always yes. Third-party developers are happy to step in to a vacuum an sell you their Dropbox (or whatever) client. They are all in the Windows Store.What about music and media? Can I play my iTunes stuff?The XBox Music system gives you music, podcasts, video, games, and apps. (Sound familiar iTunes and Google Play fans?) You can import your iTunes music from your computer to the phone. You can store music on the phone SD card, or in "the cloud" on SkyDrive.
+	I purchased this item for my son . I purchased as used item . Surprised this item came in original box with SIM card ,No signs of it being used . Haven't had no problems with it . My son loves his phone . Thank you
+	Considering this device's strong set of features and advanced hardware, I was surprised at the price. I thought I would give it a shot so I ordered, and I could not be happier. The phone is lightning fast due to the processors and works great for phone calls, texts, email, apps, web surfing, and games! The only issue was the slow shipping from China, but that is to be expected. I recommend buying from an American shipper for faster shipping times and more reliable service. Again, I highly reccomend this product: a great phone at a great price.
+	Dad uses it for work and loves the phone to death. Just like a cpu in your hand. Works great and i highly recommend!
+	Get a smart phone on a budget.  This is a great phone with most all of the smart phone features.  It does operate on Windows so if you are big into apps this is not the phone for you.  It takes practice getting used to but fits my needs at the right price.
-	DROP CALLSSCREEN TURN-OFF WITHOUT WARNINGSCHINESE CHARACERS OUT OF NOWHEREAPPLICATION BUGSBAD SCREEN RESOLUTIONWORSE CAMERA SHOTS AND AWFUL PICTURE SETTINGSI WASTED MY TIME, MONEY AND EFFORT ON THIS PHONE.WILL GLADLY SWITCH IT INTO ANY OTHER WORKING SMARTPHONE DEVICE.I AM UTTERLY DISAPOINTED ON MY AMAON PURCHASE.THIS PHONE DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR RATING.I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.
-	Do NOT Buy this product. . I normally don't write reviews but this phone is by far the worst I EVER purchased. Both front and back camera are awful. My phone stopped working altogether 3 days after it was purchased AND it cracked after falling on carpet. I paid $100 and if u pay over $5 your getting screwed. . It's very cheaply put together and I wish I would have reconsidered. Everything that glitters isn't gold
+	This phone is awesome. Very easy to set up and use. The only problemis that you must have windows 7 or 8 on your computer for it to transfer data, XP or earlier versions do not work.
+	This is a great smart phone. I was surprised how stable this windows OS turned out. It never gets frozen as some android devices do. It's great value for the money. I used it daily for my driving and listening to podcast. With T-mobile's 30$ Month Pre-Paid plan, it's perfect.The camera quality is very good, the gps (Here App) is better than Google maps and the fact that you can download regional world maps is great feature. That means, you won't need a data plan to have a GPS. T-Mobile also, provides code to unlock the phone after 40 days of services. No need to pay third party to unlock your phone.The only limitation is not enough storage on the phone, it ships with 8 Gig. I bought an 8 Gig SD card for few bucks and I am good.
+	I went from the "higher grade" Lumia 710 to this phone.  If you have a Windows Phone running Windows 7.5 this is a great upgrade.  It uses Windows 8 and the best part is you can use Pandora Internet Radio with it.  That app was lacking on the 710.  You'll get the most bang for buck with this phone.
+	Very good phone for the price.  I added a32 G chip and now have all my music andphotos on the phone as well.  Downloaded andAmazon kindle app - and now download and readbooks on it in bed at night.  No large night lightto disturb my husband in bed while I read.  Thinkmy next phone when this is done in years to come, will alsobe a Nokia.
+	I purchased this phone as an entry device into the Windows Phone 8 mobile OS and so far I am not disappointed. I can't believe the amount of good free apps that was included with the phone. Nokia Music pretty much grants me free offline music and Nokia Here Maps is a surprisingly nice and detailed offline GPS app. You can download the maps and then access the GPS offline. (Great for those on prepaid and don't have an extensive data allotment) Currently only gripe about this phone is the lack on internal storage available for apps. Although it has a microsd expansion slot, you cannot move apps to the the sdcard. The microsd card is only used to house your media (music, videos, pictures, etc.) After I installed "Halo: Spartan Assault" I was pretty much left with little to no space for other apps.
-	I hate this phone with a passion..the wifi calling don't work ever unless you pay for something for it to work ever month..picture aren't great..I wish I never got it
-	DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!I dont' know who to blame, samsung or the seller. regardless, the phone was fine for the time I had it, but after 3 months of use, the phone all of a sudden died.  No matter what I tried, the phone would not charge or come back on.  I called samsung and they told me that since the phone was an international phone, that I had to contact the country where it was made and send it off to them for repairs.  I am so furious right now I dont' know what to say.  Apparently this is the same "sudden death" bug that affected many of the galaxy sIII's a few month prior and is happening to many other people who own the Note 2.If you live in the US, and were planning on buying a international phone, or any samsung phone for that matter, I would HIGHLY advise you against it.  You get no us support, and the phone cannot be repaired in this country.  A phone that I paid almost $700 for should die after 3 months of use.  That is a bunch of bull$#^. You will also only get a very sh&^%y return policy from this seller.
+	I'd never used Windows 8 before getting this phone, and I was wary of how it was all going to work. Overall, I'm very happy with the quality of it for the price. I've had it since it was released in May. It's intuitive to set up and easy to use. I like how it ties in and syncs with Outlook . com and the Windows Phone website. I live in NYC and have had no problems with phone or internet signal on T-Mobile.The available apps, while not as plentiful as those available for iPhone and Android, offer all the features that are most important to me. Installation of apps is simple. Predictive text works very well and makes texting fun. The camera pales in comparison to more expensive smartphone cameras, but it's fine. 512MB RAM prevents me from getting some of the more intense games out there, but I haven't found it limiting to me personally. Playing games on the phone isn't that important to me, and there are still a lot of fun games that work on it.The phone itself crashes every so often, maybe once every few weeks - I have to take the battery out to get the thing to restart - but in general I find it reliable. I've had very few problems with it and am pleased to have it.
+	We are very happy with these phones.  Their small size makes them so nice to be able to just slip them in a front pocket instead of needing a case to protect them.Windows Phone OS was the first smart phone OS we have used and we really like it. I have been following the progress of Microsoft and Windows Phone and it looks like it will continue to be a good fit for us.Even though Windows Phone has fewer apps available, it has the ones I need and there is something to be said for not having to try out 10 apps to find one you like.
+	This is a great smart phone. Very easy to use. I'm in love with the camera and the layout is fun as well.
-	Ordered phone, I  had some idea they would be refurbished.  Phone had not been cleared and still had original owners number, the phone self-dialed the original number. The first owner had donated it to a charity, and wondered how I got it.  The phone also had alot of touch pad problems, would later only call numbers in he contacts list, and would self-dial the last number dialed.  Cell lounge did give a refund less shipping cost, but took about a month. But I'm glad I got a refund. The Cell Lounge staff were very polite.  I bought a new blackberry from ATT, at full price, but no problems.  If you have an old unused cell phone, destroy it either buy fire or a hammer. Don't donate or trade it in because you never know what will happen with it, and your personal information.
+	I thought it's back but I got a white one. Anyway, I like this windows phone. that will be better if it shipped with ear buds.I cut my privouse  mini-SIM to the micro-SIM into the size of the SIM card shipped from T-Mobile. it works very well after I set the network to the 2G T-Mobile network and restart the phone. I can install the necessary windows App from windows app store after creating my own windows live accounts.I like the Norkia's here map and GPS, it gives the offline location searching capability and enable to set the destination by using the Fuzzy searching.Cons: 1. Without front camera. not easy to take picture for yourself. 2. it's hard to close the application, especially for IE. but I got a trick way to close IE that switch to the tab page first, close the tab page, then using the back button to close IE.  3. Windows system occupied 2G ROM, looks it too much compared with other OS.
-	I have never seen that before ??? I used this galaxy for 2 hours and then I got a message to update the software I press OK then .... its DIE ....the galaxy now just flashing with words ( samsung galaxy note II ) thats it !!!!!!!what I have to do now ?
+	The Nokia has proven to be one of the best smart phones for the money; my wife and I are both satisfied with its features.  We searched for awhile to find a phone that fit our needs and price range; and we have found it.  Thank you.
-	I went to T moble about this problem,they replaced sims card ,still no good,T moble gave me signal buster ,able to make calls sometime but still bad I also have a old sony ericsson phone it works great,tryed to get repairs from SURGE TELECOM THE PHONE IS ONLY UNDER WARRANTY FOR 30 DAYS
+	I can't even believe that this is a "budget" phone. Yeah, it's missing flash on the camera, internal storage is low, it's only 5MP camera, but other than that, I can't even believe how amazing this phone is, even if it was not a $150 phone. It's truly perfect. The OS is super smoothe. Live tiles works great. The look and feel of the hardware is top notch. The app store has everything you ever need. It is the best phone I have ever owned. I just can't what you get for such a low price. This is the future!
-	These have defective memory chips. These 16gb note 2 have defective memory chips that cause Samsung sudden death. Look up insane chips. Samsung will not fix it. They will not help at all. There is a company that will replace the emmc chip for $150. I've used this phone for about 8 months now and it's been very difficult to keep it working. It crashes and the screen will not come back on. Many people who purchased these 16gb gt-n7100 have had complete device failures. Samsung does not service these phones and will not help...they directed me to the Phillipines, UK, and India. The UK said they can't help because it's a USA variant....it's been a nightmare.  Notice that a lot of the 5 star reviews are not labeled verified purchases...
+	We are new to smartphones, didn't want to spend a fortune if we didn't like it.  Easy to read, and I like the size, not too big.
-	my cell phone died  after 2 yrs and i needed one  fast  i used my swagbuck points  to get amazon gift cards  to get this  . the camera on it is not great  so will be looking for a new camera  next.
-	The seller listed the phone as unocked and ready to use  but I was unable to use the phone as there was an insurance block on the phone. Typically, an insurance block is placed on a phone if it's been reported as lost or stolen. Whatever the case, I was unable to activate the phone, and had to return it.  I also had to pay for the return shipping
+	[...]Updating my review to 5 stars. I have had this phone for about a month now and it is excellent! Fast, easy to use. The only issue is the lack of apps - which i knew going in with a Windows phone (why don't they subsidize apps more to eliminate this problem? Nokia and Microsoft?) Anyway, best phone I have owned - which includes Sony Ion, Samsung S, HTC One, Razor, etc....if Microsoft gets their act together on apps I may purchase a Windows tablet when I am able. The live tiles feature is great and ridiculously easy to set up and change. Battery life is excellent as well.2 weeks with it - and still love this phone! battery life great - approx day and a half without using battery saver. Everything is smooth. Live tiles are nice! $79 dollar phone beats Sony Ion and Galaxy S. Not sure how it compares to the S4 - and don't care. Great phone!Nokia build quality shows. Feels good in the hand. A little plasticy but feels good still. Removable battery! Windows apps seem smooth. Tiles interface is nice. I've had Android phones and will update with my experiences once I live with this for a few days. So far - Google account synced right away - contacts, calendar, etcBy the way, they had this model on sale at Target for $59 - went to the store and they had two versions of this phone - same model number - but supposedly different versions. The clerk said they were both GSM - so I thought that was suspect. But the one they had left was "not on sale" (it was $99). So I bought this here on Amazon. Perhaps the model on sale was for pre-paid only (I am an existing T-mobile customer). So I just took my SIM card out of my old phone and popped it into this one. Worked right away. 4g works fine so far.
-	The phone I purchased is a manufacturer product(Orange). After one week's use, I cannot make phone calls except for emergence calls. It is supposed to get the code to unlock it, I totally have no idea to get that code.
-	I bought dis and it broke in a week...its super slow... cant download on it....dis product sucks i wouldn't recommend this.
-	The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it. Initially it started freezing.  Now it will not even charge.  How do i return it?
-	First of all, I did receive the Nokia C-3 and was very delighted with it. It is a nice phone if you are into looks but that is all. The phone is not difficulty to work but I had difficulty receiving pics & text messaging and using the internet.  I called my wireless services (AT&T;) and was unable to get any help and was directed over to Nokia customer service who definitely could not help you not even with their own products.  Finally, I called customer care with the phone service where I bought the phone.  Of course, they were nice and tried to help me but the phone either was not compatible with my wireless service or the phone was defective.  I am not sure and they were not sure either.  I did send the phone back and is waiting on my refund.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone unless you know for sure your internet service would be compatible with the phone.
+	Excellent phone for its price. I was a Andriod phone user and now I am starting to like windows phone. They do have less apps but that does not mean its bad.
+	The price and product was perfect for a birthday present for someone who doesn't care to have a real fancy phone but needed something easier to text on and use a couple apps.
+	The phone was brand new, and in its original package. I just had to take it to T-mobile to get it activate. Love it
+	Disclaimer: We have been Windows 8/8.1 users since its introduction in 2012 and we like the pc dual desktop/start and live tile format.  We are also current T-Mobile customers.This phone was easy to become familiar with and use.  It is like a lite version of a Windows 8 pc without the desktop.  The Amazon price was VERY affordable and we encountered no problems changing to the new sim card (provided with the phone) with T-Mobile.  This is a good basic smartphone with only one camera, rear-facing, and no flash.  The 7gb of phone memory can fill fairly quickly but music, photos and videos can be stored on an optional micro-sd card (we have a 64gb microSDXC card).  All apps are required to be saved to the phone. The Wi-Fi calling and data really help reduce cell usage.  The phone syncs with Win 8.1 pc if same account login is used. Also T-Mobile announced in April that the Windows Phone 8.1 update will be available for 521 phones this summer.
+	no complaints. got it as a backup and to familiarized myself with windows phone.only problems i seem to have are.1. doesnt recognize my bluetooth headhones2. no camera flash
+	I've always been a fan of the windows platform, but haven't always had the best luck with windows phones.This phone is by far one of the best phones I've ever owned, and at an amazing price. I'm truly impressed with the speed of this phone, the quality of the camera, the storage space, its effortless to use. Over all, very impressed!
+	I'm astonished because of the kind of phone that I got for my ca$h!This might be the best phone I've  ever owned and it was less thanA hundred... of course its a windows phone which makes it moreAppealing but nokia is the mobile phone brand I've trusted theMost over the years. They're sturdy, strong, they never brake andWill resist the strongest fall. This nokia is fancier though so needlessTo say I'm not planing on putting it to the test but for extra precautionOr should I say protection I got the eagle shell for less than $7 here!I would recommend this phone to every iphone owner because withA fourth or a fifth of the price of one of those u get pretty much theSame but the flash...
-	The Blu Life Play is s***!!!!! Two of my friends and I bought this phone at the same time and we all experience the same problem. I have not had my Blu for 6 months yet and I am already want to slam it against the wall. My friends and I all had problems with our charge port, the case started to crack and it also started to freeze and NOOOO!!!! i do not have a bunch of apps or a virus. If your planning to buy this affordable smart phone then i beg you  DO NOT!!!! save the money and buy a reliable popular brand like sony or apple r even a nokia but not this S***!!! .
+	great budget phone. good for calling and texting. it takes some getting used to but for the price its great!!
+	pros+ price+ quality (of the touch screen, body strength)+ camera takes decent pictures+ extra storage optioncons- no front facing cam (if you need video chat from your phone)
-	The Phone didn't work there was no power button on top of it. I feel ripped off .  K.C. Clark 406 461 4002
-	it very hard to open the battery and check the SIM card or any other thing at the back so I don't like it
+	I bought this phone for my wife to use with our Family Mobile service. I was hoping to unlock the phone without having to activate it through T-Mobile. I paid several online companies to unlock it but the phone is too new and because of new government regulations, as of January 2013, the phone was not un-lockable. I was ready to return it and decided to throw caution to the wind and stick my wife's micro sim card in it. IT WORKED! No need to unlock it. I have an HTC 8X and my daughter has a Nokia 920 and I have to say, the Nokia 521 is very close to the quality. I would say there is a slight difference in the screen sharpness compared to the Nokia 920 or the HTC 8X, but that's not a huge deal for most. The process response seems to be good, little to no lag.
+	When in need of a smart phone and your out at work this is the one for any of your most need task.
-	I rate as a one becuz nothing ur work it had no back piece it won't charge it some bulls***
+	I like it. It is fast, responsive.What I like the most is:- 4 inch screen (not 3.5)- simple menu: Tiles in front, all other apps sorted and aligned once you click the (-> button).- where I live (big city metro area) I get 10.79 download and 2.47 upload (4G, not WiFi)- camera movies are recorded as mp4- my favorite apps present in the store, including to track workouts- it has Office installed.- camera button (hardware button on the side) has this half-way-press focus step and then all-the-way-down click.- very light (I mean not heavy given the size, etc)What I don't like is:- no front camera- takes microSIMS (not regular size sim)
+	Pros- Nokia 521 is the best phone under $100 and no contract.Cons- Battery connection lose and cause the phone shutdown automatically
+	Good phone and easy to use. The price was quiet cheap and it's just worthy for the money. it has everything I want from a smart phone. Great value.
+	Phone for me and my wifebest phone for that price, like that windows OS . Nice cam and sound system
+	Except for not having a front-facing camera, this phone can work just as a good as any other smartphone. For the price, no wonder its the best selling Windows Phone smartphone on the market. Nokia builds solid phones.
+	Good phone for the money. Touchscreen is good. Graphics aren't that good. the apps are ok but most are pretty expensive. this is no ios app store. better apps than a lot of other phones though. You need a Microsoft live account to acess many features. great games. keyboard works great. buttons on bottom real nice to use. slow rebooting however. you can put a micro-SD in which comes in handy as its only 8gb. that 8gb goes very fast. one huge problem: super hard to find accessories. i had to go to the t-mobile store for a case. even at the actual t-mobile store i only got three options. but you can get around that when oyu think about how its a $150 smartphone, and sure-an iPhone has lots of cases in practically every store you can imagine-even the CVS, but that's a $750 phone-not to mention the plans for it! this phone is awesome for the price and i would recommend.
-	this phone stopped working one week after it could not be returned they don't even offer an exchange this is the second item that was electronic I bought from amazon for Christmas that stopped working within days of the no return. I would have been happy even if they offered to fix the phone so be ware some are good and if you get one that is not good too bad.
-	Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.  This is the main reason I got this phone (the low price, plus ability to do Wi-Fi calling).  It took some talking to customer service to get it working correctly, but once they got it fixed, it worked well for about a month or two.  Then I was getting an increasing number of days with Wi-Fi calling glitches.  T-Mobile replaced it with another phone, same model.  It is starting to get glitch as well.  I'm not convinced they have the bugs out of the software and I am constantly (CONSTANTLY) having to fiddle with it if I want it to work.  My new replacement phone is sitting on the kitchen table, turned off, as I write this.  I have no phone now.The one thing I can say is that T-Mobile has THE BEST customer service I have ever experienced.  They are hands-down my favorite carrier, even though their coverage area is smaller than say, Verizon, because they are very willing to help you out.  However, if you are considering buying this phone and you plan to use Wi-Fi calling on a regular basis, look elsewhere.  Maybe an Android phone.  Not this one. My husband's phone is acting up as well.  Both of ours have had problems working correctly on the cellular network as well.  Just don't buy this phone.
+	We bought this for my wife, her 2nd time testing the smart phone waters.  She had a budget android last time, and frankly that was a disaster.  She LOVES this phone already, has everything she needs.  Is it perfect for a heavy user?  Probably not, but for the average Joe/Jane?  Yes.Indeed specific use apps are missing, but she wouldn't miss them, and at this point I am inclined to go the windows phone route, bravo Nokia/Microsoft.  Great product and great OS.The price is right, and tmobile's services has been great where we are located (spokane wa).
+	I love it thought it had a camera on the front but. I love it it what I asked for and more
+	Windows phones are not used by much of the market here in the US but they are interesting phones. I purchased this phone for my grandfather since he thinks most smartphones are too expensive. I had no experience with nokia since the small brick phones they made back in ~2005, they were quite sturdy and could take any beating you threw at them. I was definitely surprised when I opened the package, it felt like a quality product not what I would have expected from a $100 phone (what I paid at the time). Setup was easy and it was a plus that all the tiles were resizable, especially for an older person with less experience with smartphones. They live tiles show relevant information without being intrusive. The widows store while smaller than google play or the app store had everything that was needed for him, it was a plus that it came with Nokia Here Maps that could be used for offline navigation were downloadable for free. The camera is average, good enough for outdoor/ well lit photos but darker shots will be blurry. The screen does not have the highest resolution but it is better than most of its competitors in this price range. Its definitely a great buy even for use as an mp3 player (can accept up to a 64GB micro sd card) or as an alternative to a garmin with more functionality. Great little phone, hopefully Nokia can top it next year.
+	Great phone for this price with lot of fitures to use and  save big money compared with T-Mobile store. I love this phone so far no problems at all.
+	I'm loving all the features of this windows phone and you cant beat the price point. The simple navigation and speed of apps is better the my android. The only issue is availability of certain apps.
+	I love this phone.  Have had it for over a month now.  Got it on HSN for 79.99!  Included a soft silicone like blue case, car charger and AC adaptor. Phone has never frozen and I love the live tiles. Very intuitive (for me) and easy to use.  Still learning all the features.  Internet browsing is a breeze.  Love the layout of the phone.  Yes, it does not have as many apps as Apple or Android, but that does not bother me.  Used to have the T-mobile 30.00 a month plan (1500 talk/text and a pathetic 30 Mb of data). Use this phone so much now that I updated my plan to the 50.00 a month unlimited everything.  For the price and features of this high quality phone...I am a very happy customer.  Thanks Nokia (and Amazon for letting me write this review even though I did not buy it here)!
-	no sim and the standby time is too shortoh yenot very wellApple iPhone 4 8GB (Black) - Verizon
+	Despite being with T-Mobile for 7 years they have really given me and my husband notoriously bad customer service. In order to bypass their myopic ways without spending $500+ to break our contracts we found these fabulous phones on Amazon to upgrade our old poop machines! These phones are a great value and are simply amazing. I love all the features including their ability to compute MS Word and Excel! (Obsessive spread sheeter much?) You can personalize everything. These Nokias are pretty heavy duty as within the first 24 hours of owning it I dropped consistently with no damage to the device. They are, dare I say, better than Iphones which I find to be heavy, delicate, overpriced, overrated, and somewhat glitchy, Anyway, thanks Amazon! You restored my faith in humanity!
-	There were a lot of things wrong with the phone i have received:1. The phone doesn't detect my Sim card and its signal for the carrier is inaccurate.2. It doesn't detect when i put my earphones in the phone. It plays on both the earphones and the phone speaker so im unable to privately listen to my music. The sound quality is the worst i ever heard from a phone honestly.3. It wont let me pull down the menu bar.4. Theirs a limit on the KB of sending MMS messages. The limits only 300kb and i cant send most of the pictures i have.5. For the carrier i chose(which is straight talk)i am supposed to be able to call, text, and have internet for unlimited. The phone is slow and takes up to ten minutes just to load onto Google when i have full service and it wont even allow me to make local calls!6. When i try to download music, it would say my song is complete but when i listen to the song on the device the song glitches more like skipping as if i got it off a scratched CD!7. But the design of the phone itself is decent. I loved the fact that it came with a flip-case and the battery life is off the chain.8. For a temporary phone to text off of, its great. The Wifi on it is amazing and fast.9. But i am all about the sound quality of my music and this is definitely not compatible.
-	I bought this phone couple of days back, Now the phone speaker not working properly and getting "kirch kreech" sound  while playing any audio/video.I would like to return this product now :(.
-	its the worth phone u will find every thing is bad not clear slow short betray i could tall u one think DO NOT BUY
+	I needed to upgrade my phone, I was still using the old push button type phone.  I wanted a smart phone to use with my current TMobile pay as you go plan, so that I could take pictures and share with my friends.  I received the phone quickly and made one call to TMobile to have my information switched to the new chip.  My old chip was not compatible with the new phone.  No big deal.  It took me a little bit to figure out the phone, but I finally did.  I absolutely love this phone and would recommend it.  And I love, love, love Amazon!
+	I bought this phone and finally cut my land line for good. It's ONE great phone. The sound is clear and I love being able to change all the settings to my own personal needs, wants and desires..... so many apps to choose from and such a good price. I don't need a phone to do anything more than bring me incoming calls and allow me to call out, but if I want to check email and Facebook, I can.Although this is being called a *BASIC* phone it does WAY more than I need it to do and it's been a blast trying to figure it all out. Since this is my first SMARTPHONE, I've been taking my time learning all the varied attributes, most of them I'll never use but it's nice to have them available. The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection. The second is that I can BLOCK all those telemarketing calls which drive me nuts, my land line wouldn't allow me to do this unless I paid for that service. The third is that I love the NOSTALGIA ring tone as it sounds like a phone from days gone by. My dogs seem to enjoy this ring tone the best too.....Don't hesitate to buy this phone....it's really such a good bargain and it's worth it weight in gold. I LOVE IT !
-	Cheap quality and phone locked and is locked. Couldn't use it on my network and is just sitting idle. Would've returned it if I still have box it came in.
+	Great phone for the money. I bought for my son for 80 bucks he loves it.you cant wrong with this inexpensive cell. Best deal on amazon. Stay up player
-	A phone I wouldn't recommend to anyone , basically the phone is just big it doesn't do that much the volume is bad on it also.
+	This phone is pretty good. I am still getting to know all about it. I am not real computer savvy but I really like the phone and the price was really great. I had an LG android before I bought this one. I had that phone for almost a year. I like the ability to surf the web. Also the camera on this phone is very good compared to my android. I bought three phones one for me and each of my two teenagers.  This phone met all of the requirements we were looking for.  We all would recommend this phone to anyone.
+	Maybe it's just because I'm coming off a phone that I'm only using because my newer "flagship" phone died on me and I needed to go back to something three years older to fill the gap...but I decided to take the plunge to abandon Android for Windows Phone 8 and I've gotta say I'm very happy with my purchase.For the price, the features are excellent. The phone doesn't lag even with its lower specs, the screen is perfect for one-handed use, it's light and easily slips in and out of my pocket and it simply doesn't feel cheap even though it was!I love having all the integrated services available in the Microsoft ecosystem, including Office, Outlook(dot)com. X-Box, SkyDrive and more, which compete toe-to-toe with anything Google or Apple have to offer. It's a refreshing change of scenery with just the right amount of customizability without overwhelming me with options.And say what you will about the so-called limited app selection, I am having no trouble finding the things I want and need on Windows Phone. I don't always get all the exact same apps I had with Android, but I have found alternatives that are just as good or in those few cases where there isn't anything available, there's always mobile web versions of the sites and services I need that suit me just fine. If you're not picky about having all the EXACT apps you're addicted to, you won't have any trouble getting the functionality you need with any WP8 device. Those who are on the fence, just know Microsoft is not backing down from mobile and the apps will come with time.On the downside, eventually I'll want a phone that takes great photos so I know this won't be my daily driver for long, but the camera is adequate for my immediate needs and much better than what I was using prior. Also, the limited 8 GB of memory can be troublesome considering you can't install apps on an SD card, but for a casual to moderate smartphone user it shouldn't be a problem.All-in-all, I have very little to complain about with WP8 and this phone in particular. It's not a powerhouse, but for the price it absolutely CANNOT be beat. I'm excited to continue familiarizing myself with all the new stuff this phone and OS can do.
-	hi am from Venezuela sending me wine coming to this date a telephone team brought me a defect the power button will not work now can not do anything these damaged that hassle!
+	I love my phone. It came in a short time frame and I'm able to do all that I need. I just wish it had a flash BUT it takes great pics when the lighting is good!!
-	Not good at all it the worse phone i never had it doesn't want to receive incoming call slow like a turtle
+	I love love love this phone, first off I use the phone with my Family Mobile account with WalMart and this phone is still super fast! I really only use my phones for pictures, texting and some apps and this phone makes it so easy for all of the above the camera lenses that u can choose from are ridiculous! :) amd Texting is a breeze
-	I had this phone for 4 months ,then it did not work anymore,constantly showing No Service. T-Mobil stores could not figure out the reason. T-Mobil sent me a refurbished one under warranty. then the exact same thing happend. I had to return it again. you may want to stay away from this Nokia.
+	Well i have a friend that has one and i know how good they are so i got one here on this site and i am looking to getting it
+	Great smart phone! I had a Samsung Galaxy 2. It locked up frequently, opened unwanted apps, did not perform well. The Nokia 521 works much better, battery lasts really well (all day), and is super easy to use. I would have it over an I phone any day! T-mobile works well too. Wireless calling feature is really good as well.Both my wife and I are really satisfied with quality, features, and especially the reasonable price.UPDATE: Now, several months later, still very happy with phone AND with t-mobile. Both work well, great improvement over both samsung galaxy 2 and Sprint.
-	The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
-	THIS CELPHONE IS VERY BAD, I was totally disappointed when buying this computer, I received the phone and it looked great .. after a few minutes of turning it on the phone was shut down and most never returned to light .. What a shame! I really do not recommend it, do not trust this phone! , I recommend BLU LIFE PLAY!! ! if this is a good phone ...
+	I have had windows phones for almost 5yrs now and I love this one it works for me...alot of people knock the windows phones but I love mine and I have had an Iphone before and will never go back to it again I dont care how many gagets it has I LOVE MY WINDOWS PHONE!!!!!!!
-	The storage space sucks! The keypad works when it wants to and randomly kicks me off websites and reboots on its own.
+	I recently received this phone and I have to say that I am pretty impressed so far. It seems to have a pretty good antenna because the signal quality is a lot better than my LG Optimus on the T-Mobile network which makes a difference when you live in a place where it is difficult to get a signal. One thing that really stands out to me and which I like a lot is the Windows 8 OS on the phone, it is well thought out especially Internet Explorer, I like how the address bar is on the bottom and not the top. As a web and mobile designer I can really appreciate it.
-	This phone looks brand new and all the buttons and what not works. The only problem is the battery is a piece of crap and holds zero charge. I would not recommend this to anyone since I have to take my charger everywhere with me. Do not buy.
-	Phone seems good but I called T-Mobile costumer service to activate it and they said the sim card was used. Don"t  know why. Packaging was new
-	While it worked it was a great watch.  Unfortunately, it just fell apart.  For the price I paid, I expected more quality.
-	This phone is nothing more than a glorified toy.Consider: There is no way to download and use items unless they are downloaded through the apps already installed on the phone.Consider: There is no mp3 player. It is not possible to download or install one. Thus it is not possible to play anything other than what can be downloaded through the apps already installed on the phone.Consider: Not all Nokia Lumia 521's come with an SD slot. I thought they did, but obviously not because mine doesn't have one.Consider: Any items you do download are stored on the phone, but there is no way to find them. There is no way to get to the root menu to locate the items you download. The only items you can find are the ones downloaded using one of the apps already installed on the phone.This phone is nothing more than a glorified toy.
+	I love love love this phone!!!! It exceeded my expectations of it and I would definitely purchase it again! I'm addicted to playing with it!
-	I had my phone for 6 months and it just died. When you buy an international phone it most likely will not be with a warranty. I have tried to get warranty service with no luck. Do your research and check it out. If you are going to buy I would strongly suggest insurance for the phone.
-	I do not like it at all. First its not a 4g phone. I can not access my hotspot. This is the worst phone I ever brought in my life.
-	this phone has several software problems. your messages could be deleted itself or your contact list could be ! i dont like it
-	I purchased this phone looking at the specification. However, the actual delivered phone model is Samsung Galaxy S III GT I9300 which is different from Samsung Galaxy S lll I9300. The GT - I9300 has low system configuration such as lower RAM and no 4G support.
+	This phone takes a little getting used to because it is a windows 8 phone.  But I like it so far.
+	I bought 2 of these phones for my parents so they could have a smart phone.  They don't use their phones a whole lot so I didn't want to get something like an iphone (which I have and paid $600 for...and incidentally just died after 14 months so I'm pissed!)  Anyways, I digress.  This phone for the price is truly amazing.  It does everything my iphone does.  Why am I paying so much for my stupid iphone when I could do all the same things on this phone?  Well, it doesn't support some of the games I play, but how lame is that? lol!  This phone really does do everything though.  I'm really happy with this purchase and my parents really like the phones.
-	My boyfriend had the phone for about a week. The Google talk icon kept popping up on the screen for no reason. No pictures wouldn't save on the phone. A huge disappointment!
-	Wow, buying this phone was an utter mistake. It started with T-Mobile lying to me telling me they would unlock the phone for free (which is why I bought it), then saying I had to wait 40 days and pay $40. This was after being told to call multiple numbers and being given multiple answers by multiple people, each one claiming the other was wrong.There is a massive problem with the music player, which duplicates songs as much as four times per song, but if you delete any of the extras, the track won't play at all. The music player also randomly decided what songs would and wouldn't play, despite being in the same format.On top of that, the BlueTooth didn't work- maybe I just had a bad model, but it was still frustrating (same as when the camera app stopped being able to share photos via any method). I tried to return the phone via Microsoft (from whom I bought it) and encountered the worst customer service I have ever seen (even worse than the liars at T-Mobile). After hours spent trying to return the phone due to its faultiness (and being told to hard restart the phone- their tech support's only offered solution, which of course failed to solve anything), I finally gave up, and sold it to some poor soul who disregarded my warnings in favor of the dirt cheap price.Outside of making phone calls and accessing the Internet, this phone was pretty useless, from its piss poor music player to its clunky and annoying OS (you can forget about getting any cool apps that Android or Apple users get), Nokia, Microsoft, and any retailer should be ashamed of being associated with this phone.
-	THIS PHONE CAN ONLY BE UNLOCKED BY T-MOBILE AND IT'S AT THEIR SOLE DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND UNLOCK IT FOR YOU.  SINCE IT'S A CARRIER-BRANDED PHONE, THE MANUFACTURER CAN'T SELL THE UNLOCK CODES TO THOSE THIRD PARTY UNLOCKING SERVICES WHO WILL ALL FALSELY-CLAIM THEY CAN UNLOCK IT FOR YOU AND THEN ENTANGLE YOU IN AN ARM WRESTLING MATCH TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK FOR THEIR FAILED EFFORTS.
+	I have enjoyed my phone, nd I am glad I choose this phone, nd this provider!  It was here on time. Was packaged nd delivered n excellent shape!
-	Bought this watch and it lasted only 3 months with careful use. No over charging, no water, no shock or abuse. Just want turn on any more.
-	I have not been pleased with this product. This was supposed to be a new phone, but the charger never worked from the get-go. The phone would drop calls if a text was coming in the the same time. All were inconvenient, but I needed a phone and the seller wouldn't send me a new phone until they received the old one. Now, six months later the screen  went dead and the phone is non-returnable. Would not recommend this seller!
+	Now all my family members share the same OS Windows 8.Four Windows Phone, Windows Tablet, Windows 8.1 Laptop, Windows 7 Desktop.Guess what? it is never imaged how smooth the files transfer, network sharing, printing it is !NO learning curves for all members, everyone could grab one the system and run immediately!Best money, best systems, fair/decent price and no rip off from exclusive manufacturer.
+	Cute looking, works well, only one small problem, which I should have considered before.. shucks! At my age I could do with a bigger screen. Great for the kids!
+	The product meets or exceeds every specification and is one of the best values for the money I have found in a long time.
-	It's a good looking phone, but it didnt work at all. The volume was too low, screen didnt wanna work, buttons didnt wanna work.
-	I bought my first one Nov 2013. In Jan 2014 it stopped charging. Called Straight Talk. Very time consuming and not good customer relations. They sent me another phone. When I got it, it was a refurbished phone. Since i had paid for new, I expected a new replacement. Now it is April 2014 and this phone has stopped charging. Called Straight talk today, got a little better customer service, they are sending me a replacement phone. I ask if i could have a new phone this time and she said they had no control over what phone i would get, new or refurbished. I thought I was being smart by getting an entry level, no contract phone. Now i see why people pay the money for a contract phone. No hassel in returning it. I am not a happy customer and if I did buy another no contract phone, I would put out more money for it and hopefully get a better product.
-	I've resisted the urge to vent, but with every day that passes I fume more and more about the performance of this phone.In the beginning, our relationship was good.  I pressed buttons, it responded.  People called me and my phone rang accordingly.  It was a golden time.  A time that I shouldn't have taken for granted.  But I'm human, and so I did.It is a darker age now....God, how I miss the phone I once knew.It started out innocently enough.  Small lag times.  You know what I'm talking about.  I'd turn the screen off and the sound effect would follow a second or two later.  Then three.  Then ten.  Soon enough I'd have the phone back in my pocket and be halfway out the door before I heard the muffled click.  Things continued to get worse.Apps that had always worked began hanging and crashing.  Sometimes the phone would ring, while sometimes I just received a notification that someone had left a message because they couldn't reach me.  Response times to everything grew longer and longer.  It became customary to click on an icon and then find something else to do while the phone tried coming to grips with this request.  Sometimes it just couldn't do it.It tried committing suicide two weeks prior.  It jumped off my nightstand, but only managed to crack its screen.  Now my phone is ugly AND unresponsive.Every day that goes by in which I don't hurl the phone across the room is a victory.  Or is it?  I just don't know anymore.
-	Well, I finally had the chance to open the product this past weekend to use this phone.  There are one major issue with this phone, when you try to slide and open to use it to dial out, the dial icon is not responsive to your touch.  So, that means you have to keep on pressing it to make it open up to make a phone call.  Now that's nuts!  Today is only Tuesday and I just open it this past Sunday to use it, and this is one major headache.  I can't see myself having to keep on pressing the dial icon for several seconds to make calls.  I just want a phone to make simple phone calls with one touch and that's it.  Also, the screen brightness is not so good, it's dim.  So overall this phone is not ideal to use in an emergency situation.
+	ORIGINAL REVIEW:I thought about waiting on the Lumia 925, but after reading how much the Lumina 521 has to offer, I decided that since I tend to change phones about every 2 years, it made more sense to go with the phone that was lighter on my wallet. After finding that my local WalMart had one phone left, I snagged it and haven't regretted my purchase one bit.What I love about the phone:1. WiFi calling (set up instructions below) - calls are clear, but calls don't hand off to cellular network if you step outside of your WiFi range2. Tethering Capable (must add to your plan as a separate service, but no charge)3. MicroSD slot (up to 64GB)4. Camera is touch adjustable5. Adjustable font size6. Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7. Transfer My Data App makes switching phones super easy - even transfers text messages8. All of the Nokia app collection for free (drive, music, photobeamer, yousendit, etc).9. Touchscreen is very responsive - sensitivity is adjustable10. Visual voicemail (free, but have to enable your account)The few negatives:1. Camera isn't fancy, but is 5mp. Use fingers/touchscreen to zoom. There is not a flash, so indoor pics can be blurry.2. Phone supposedly won't be able to access the LTE network if available in your area. I haven't confirmed this claim. The phone speed is fast enough for my needs, but I am not a gamer.3. Plastic back. Does it matter? Most people use a cover anyway.The OKs:1. Screen is nice and easy to see indoors. Sunlight causes difficulties. I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2. Phone does not come with a headset3. Phone does not come with a car charger4. The ear sound can get tinny. I use to up the volume to hear on other phones. In this phone, I turn down the volume to get rid of the tinny sound. This is not noticeable when on speakerphone.I really like this phone - it has all of the features I want at a fantastic price point. If you are buying a Windows phone (and you should), this phone is a no-brainer.WiFi calling set-up: get wifi calling enabled on your t-mobile account (free set up), and make sure that you have a wifi enabled sim card (free at TMobile store).  Then do a hard reset on the phone (not just a simple update).  Reset is found at Settings - About - reset your phone. Once you do these steps, a WiFi calling button will appear on your home screen. Press it and choose your option (Wi-Fi Preferred, Cellular Preferred, Wi-Fi Only).EMail/Social Media set-up: was a Breeze. I set up Hotmail, outlook, Gmail, roadrunner and a business email. Facebook and other social media is also very easy to set-up.Font size & High contrast screen is at Settings - Ease of Access.Tethering is at Settings - Internet sharing.(This review is not intended to endorse a third party seller.)SOFTWARE UPDATE (news release 8/16/13):The Windows Phone Amber update--available for Nokia's Lumia 920, 820, 720, 620, 520, 928, 822, 521 and 810--includes Smart Camera, which promises users the tools to create higher-quality photos by taking a series of rapid-fire shots then editing the best elements of each image together, further bolstered by filters and effects.Windows Phone Amber also touts Nokia Glance Screen, which adds a clock to the screen when the phone is inactive, alongside indicators that depict the battery level when the device is running on a low battery, charging or set to silent mode. "You can activate the Nokia Glance screen in the 'display and touch' section in Settings by swiping left to 'glance,'" said Nokia Conversations blog editor Ian Delaney. "Nokia Glance screen will be available for all WP8 Lumia devices except the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 625, which have a smaller display memory."Following customer requests, Windows Phone Amber additionally resurrects features from older Nokia handsets. Users may now flip the phone over to mute incoming calls and double tap the screen as an alternative to the unlock key."The rollout starts now first for the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 in selected countries as well as the Lumia 521, Lumia 810 and Lumia 928 in the U.S.," Delaney said. "Exact delivery timings will vary by region, phone and operator, but we expect the update to reach your Lumia 520, Lumia 620, Lumia 720, Lumia 820 or Lumia 920 by the end of September."UPDATE (12/6/13T Mobile changed their international features in Oct 2013, allowing free data & texting in areas they serve (phone calls .10 unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).  I took & used my phone to Peru & it worked quite well, both roaming on the Moviestar network (free) & hooking up to wifi.  I tethered to my tablet as well.UPDATE (3/28/14)I just returned from a trip to Vietnam where I used the Lumia 521 continuously both roaming & WiFi. In airports and other venues that had spotty or no WiFi, I tethered my phone to my tablet & to another user's tablet. WiFi calling provided free calls back to the states & using my apps, including Facebook, was a breeze.  TMobile's free international features are awesome (free texting & data, $.20/minute network calls, free WiFi calling to states, not in-country) and saved me hundreds of dollars.That said, I'm finding that I use my phone a lot more to take pictures, and the 521 only has a 5mp camera & no front facing camera.  The 5mp is OK & my phone has taken some very nice pictures, but now I want more & will probably upgrade to the Lumia 930 when it comes out if it isn't insanely priced (the 930 is suppose to have a 20mp camera, a front facing camera).
-	this phone is a piece of junk!!!! when I got the phone it looked nice an all but I couldn't hear out the phone. the only way I could hear anybody or for them to hear me the phone had to be on speaker phone or I had to have the head phones in... this phone is a waste  of money.... DO NOT BUY
+	I've moved to this phone from a Samsung Exhibit 4G running Android 2.3. Not the latest Gen but definitely not 1st gen.I wanted a change, and better Android phones were out of my price range (so was the IPhone). I have a Mac, use Windows 7, and also have an IPad. So I can say I have some experience with almost all of the OS.I've used the phone for about a week and half and am quite happy with it. None of the competitors offer anything as well designed, sturdy, speedy, at this price level.Pros:The HERE navigate app is excellent. You download the data for your state or current location and does not depend on your data connection which saves you download limits. The navigation was spot on, and the roads seemed up-to-date. I liked it better than the google navigation app available on Android 2.3. It actually seemed more up-to-date in terms of the network. However, Google maps is far better at locating points of interest. There is a new pizza restaurant around the corner. Google Maps had it instantly, HERE does not even show up.This phone is responsive and fast. It takes a little getting used to because it manages applications differently. I didn't find a Task Manager, so you have to back out of applications to close them. Not better, just different. The battery life is really good. I had wifi on and used it moderately for 2 1/2 days without draining it. I would have to charge my Android phone daily (it is also a couple of years old). It comes with 4gb of storage is better than the 400 mb on my phone, and both have room to expand with an Micro SD Card. I don't think you can install apps on the sd card on Windows Phone 8 but I'm not sure.It's just kind of fun to use. I think the Tiles are a really nice UI, and simple to work with. Everything is right there for you. I imagine you can modify Android phones to do this as well, but the change is nice.Cons:I didn't think the lack of flash would bother me, but it does. I'm surprised there isn't one given that Nokia is focusing on camera's in the phone. Nothing I can really do about that.The apple app store has by far the largest selection of apps. Most of the big ones are on Android too. Windows Store lags behind. In some ways this is advantage, because it isn't bloated with a lot of crap Apps like the Apple store. Some of the ones I wish were there but haven't found: NPR, NBA, politico, official google apps (e.g. youtube). All the social media ones are there (Facebook and Twitter). I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app. This is because of market share. Companies are better served making apps for phones that make up 90% of the market. The apps I have found are generally pretty good, though. If there is an app that you can't live without, chances are it is not on the Windows Phone.I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a phone at this price range.Update:I would still recommend the phone, but now that I've used it longer I have some other comments. With the most recent update, they have made it easier to exit out of applications. Holding the back button gives you a screen grab of each open application and a little X in the corner to close it.The web browser kit on this phone is not the greatest. It is based on IE, and sometimes it renders pages funny and locks up. There are some other browsers available, but I wish Firefox would put their mobile version on Windows phone.The phone does have trouble reconnecting to the network after it has been lost. I was in a couple of places this past week that lost the network, but when I was back within range the phone didn't update. I had to turn off the phone or enter flight mode to get it back.A minor annoyance - the voice mail requires you to turn up the phone volume to hear it. I would think that it would automatically do this.
+	Bought this phone for my dad to use. Recieved a brand new phone in perfect working condition straight out of the box. The phone also supports a variety of different languages which is a plus.
-	the phone will not charge at all and its been like that since i received it. i like the phone when it was working though.
+	Price was right, $65, everything works great, I use it to tether my tablet in my car too and I love it. I would highly recommend this phone to everyone... Screw IPhone & Galaxy!! :)
+	I bought this Nokia 521 directly from Amazon. The phone arrived fast and was packed well. No complains.The phone is really lightweight and looks decent. Though I am not too happy about the white backside. To cover the back, I bough a black case.The screen is sharp, bright, and colorful. This Nokia runs Windows that is really intuitive and easy to use even for a person (like me) who never had a smartphone before.  The phone feels very fast and responsive. The menus look pretty. You can choose  color and content of your home screen as well as size, color, and location of the icons. Also, I chosen Bing background (beautiful landscapes that update every day or two) for the lock-screen and like it a lot. WiFi works great. It connects to my home or work network instantaneously. So, the only time I use my cellular data is when I travel to/from work. The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.I quickly set my Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Facebook, and Linked-In accounts. After that, I went to the People app and linked profiles of my contacts in all my e-mail social accounts. The phone pulled and aggregated all info from those accounts. So now my contacts all have pictures, birthdays, e-mails, and phone numbers from all those accounts. Very convenient.The pre-installed Nokia apps are very useful. The Scout, Maps, and Navigation helped me a lot when I was on business trip in St Louis. It helped me choose a place to eat or to shop and then guided me to that place. The App Store does not have as many apps as Android (I also own a Nook HD+ tablet that runs Android) or iOS have, but the most important apps are there. And it looks like the quantity and quality of apps are improving.My only complain is regarding the Music player. For some reason, it is unable to play music by folders or play entire albums that have more than one artist. I like to listen to different music when I am working/commuting (easier, more relaxing) and when I am exercising in the gym (harder, more aggressive). I have several albums composed of songs by different artists. This Nokia only plays either from all my collection or by artist. Even though it has an option to choose music by album, it treats an album that contains songs by several artists as sets of albums and plays songs from originally chosen artist only - even if play is set to random!Other than that, I am very happy with my Nokia. It is a great phone and even greater bargain! Just hope someone will write an app to play music by folder or by album.
-	The phone worked for only 4 days. This is the absolute worse item I have ever purchased from Amazon. The phone slowed down in loading information, it was almost impossible to use and finally it just blanked out. I am Very disappointed.
-	BUTTONS WOULDN'T WORK WITHOUT BEATING IT.  CHARGER PORT STOPPED CHARGING. PHONE WOULD RING BUT YOU COULDN'T ANSWER BECAUSE THE BUTTONS WERE HARD TO PUSH.  POINT BLANK...SAVE YOUR MONEY
+	My first smart phone so I have nothing to compare it with but I love it.  It gets the job done, takes beautiful clear pictures and looks sleek and stylish.
-	The phone seems to be amazing and it does do a lot of what is said in the good reviews.  That is one part of the story. This phone was made for the hungarian market. So they sent me a European plug that after taking to Amazon they made well on it. .  After +30 days I was shocked to see that the phone was not charging and the screen was getting blurry and eventually black.  When I called Amazon I was told that I would have to send it back for refund (What they did not say was that $114 were going to be deducted for Restocking fee reduction). Need I need to say more? Sold by Tech Giant
+	First off I buy most everything from Amazon.  I LOVE Amazon.  But I always check other sources and found the phone $17 cheaper elsewhere.  Now Amazon has matched that price which I found amazing but too late.That being said I had checked with T-Mo to make sure I could transfer my old Pay As You Go sim (larger size) with $80 worth of time to the 521 (mini sim).  Indeed I could.  All I had to do was call T-Mo and the phone number and $80 was transferred over to the 521 and I was good to go.Since the old phone was a back-up phone for my senior husband it was only used for an occasional call or texting ($ .20/.10 each).  Now, however he can get online with wifi and fiddle around with tons of apps including free texting apps/Facebook - etc.  One app I am still hoping to get however is the Magic Jack app - which presently is only available for the iPhone and Android.  So Keep in mind a lot of apps are NOT available on a Win 8 phone.BUT one thing I learned was this.  With the T-Mo Pay as you go plan you do not get any data period.  But more important is this fact.  The 521 comes with wifi calling.  I thought this was a wonderful feature until I found out if would use MINUTES IF you have the Pay as you go plan!  Since I did NOT have a T-Mo unlimited minute plan it uses minutes whether you use the phone and use wifi calling or the T-Mo cellphone tower.  Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).  But that is ok because I get a poor T-Mo signal at my house anyhow.  So the phone is set to prefer wifi for calling but is seldom used for calling anyhow.Kind of confusing right? But the bottom line is if you do get a poor T-Mo signal at your house this phone will direct the call over wifi first if you choose that option.  But like I said it will use your minutes if you have the Pay as You Go plan.  I have had Pay as You Go for about 5 years now - only costs $10 a year to buy minutes so all your unused minutes roll over for another year.Ok now to review the phone (if you have read this far).  This phone is excellent!  Good sound quality - decent camera - etc.  Well worth $100.  If nothing else you can use it as a camera and MP3 player.  Plus you don't have to use iTunes for things like ringtones!  Cool!
+	Easy to use, responsive, more detail and depth. Everything an iPhone lacks. I can already see using his phone for several years. Plus, on the T-Mobile network,  only pay $5 a day (When I use it). Bargain.
+	Awesome little phone . I share internet to my. iPad past my data sharing .i still used everyday to shared .good buy cox .
+	I have had this phone for almost a month now and I really like it; however, sometime it freezes and when you try to click on any of the apps , it does not open which causes me to turn it off and on again so....
+	This is the 2nd Nokia 521 I have added to our phones in the home. My wife likes this phone even more than I do.
+	I own this phone already and love it so much that I bought another to share. Great phone! Nice needed apps.
-	I don't like the 8GB version of the phone not enough space on it for all my songs and my apps.
+	This is really a neat little phone, very durable, and easy to hold. The graphics, show up well.  I've had many phones over the years, and will say that this is my fave!
-	This is an "international" Note 2.  Which means it will not work with Verizon.  It doesn't matter that it is "factory unlocked".  If you want a Note 2 that's Verizon compatible, make sure it's the model "i605" and is listed as "CDMA capable".The description on Amazon hides all of this.
-	As a loyal AT&T; customer, I was offered this phone for free.  My previous phone was an 8 year old Samsung flip phone that had been to hell and back but was going to break in half if I dropped it one more time. AT&T; wanted to be able to sell me more services so they offered to replace my antiquated Samsung for free with this Pantech.  It has a "breeze" mode and an "advanced" mode. The breeze mode offers no choice of ring tones, and the one ring tone you get is really lame.  Texting always starts in "ABC" mode instead of "predictive" mode, so you always have to switch modes before you start a text.  It can't remember any of your habits or preferences, nor can they be programmed.  As far as I can tell, you can not add words to its dictionary for future use in predictive mode.  If you ever want to end a sentence with ellipsis (...) or finish a sentence with an emoticon (e.g. ". :)") you have to hit options, left arrow on "input mode", scroll down and select "symbols", then move the arrow buttons select a "." or a ":" or a ")" and then hit "insert".  You can only select one symbol at a time, so you have to go through this ridiculous process three times just to get "..."Lately it has been freezing in the middle of my text messages, then it goes to "searching SIM" (or some similar message) and it then reboots and loses my text message.  I deleted some photos I had taken, figuring I was out of memory space, but that did not fix this problem.I was just trying the "advanced" mode today for the first time and there are still no choices for ring tone in advanced mode.  Nor is texting less cumbersome.It is better than having no cell phone, and for me it was free, but there is no way I would pay even $30 for this phone.
-	Since Nokia is Microsoft truly a bad phone,on my second one in 3 months,first one could not connect to internet and dropped calls,this new one,cant connect to send a text,the designer must have been drunk to put the volume button on the top corner so that even when locked,can turn volume low or off so you never know what is going on ....the plus side you can talk to it from a pocket or purse as long as you talk slow....speech recognition is not great..I am getting an LG android ....cant deal with MICROSOFT
+	son loves it best  price I could find anywhere for the phone.Thank you so much for selling these phones
-	I ordered this phone for my sister who was visiting from the Caribbean so she could take it back home with her.  I paid for expedited service and the phone still did not arrived until after she left.  I was told they had a mixed up. I then had to spend extra money to get it to the Caribbean.  My sister just got the phone and now it is not working.  She cannot hear her incoming calls.  Her friends can hear her but she cannot hear them.  I am very disappointed.  Now I tried to send this phone back before I sent it to the Caribbean but they gave me the run around and told me I would have to pay a fee etc.  DO NOT GET THIS PHONE IT DOES NOT WORK AND THE COMPANY THAT IS SELLING THIS PHONE WILL NOT WORK WITH YOU!!
-	beautiful phone , but one  giant piece of crap. nothing works.  my last problem was  that  the headphone will be on and the speaker will be on too.
+	Great phone, does just what it says,I have never had a phone with internet before. Easy to use would recommend this to anyone.
-	I would recommend that no one purchase this phone, my sister and I purchased the Lumia 521 just before Xmas and we are yet to be able to make or recieve a text phone call or much less use the device. First of all the packaging was very poor and unsatisfactory, The phone comes locked we had to purchase an unlocked code from Nokia still its not working. While trying to input the purchased unlocked code the phone screen became blue and totally unresponsive  I am shocked at Nokia and MOST dissatisfied, disappointed and aphauled that a so called reputable company like Amazon would even agree to sell such a phone. This is a scam and false advertisement. Amazon please rectify and stop selling Nokia Lumia  it's blatant robbery. The Star rating for this phone should be -1.
-	Could not connect too the Internet?Could not find a Provider.I would not buy again..Did not come with a memory Card
-	I am very disappointed with the screen clarity of my new Note 2. The pictures on websites seem tend toward the red spectrum. Whereas my HTC EVO 4G seemed to have perfect picture clarity, my Samsung Note 2 would perhaps get 1 star out of 10. I'm very disappointed. Also, the word-wrap does not work as well as on my HTC. Hopefully you're reading this Samsung, and you can fix these issues with a few updates. Of course, maybe HTC will come out with a phone the size of the Note 2.
+	This is one of the best purchases I've ever made! Not only does this phone have all kinds of downloadable apps that you can get from the Windows store but it also has just about everything that all of those high-end phones have except for the fact that you don't have to take out a second mortgage on your home in order to get it!! I've loved everything about my Nokia Lumia since the day it arrived & I guarantee you will too!
+	I brought three of them . They work just as well as the iphone ,Great speed ,Sleek look,Light weighted ,Great amplified sound, You will really enjoy this phone
-	It just stop working and would not turn on.I tried everything to see even buying a new charger. I do love the phone but I wish things were different.
-	the phone is very nice, but if I ask for an unlocked phone so you do not get locked sent me, in my country I will not do anything with this phone seems a mockery and a lack of respect and seriousness on your part I hope this post serves of something and hope for answers saticfactorias amazon or you I'm upset about this you do not know the need of others to do these things. if you want to buy a cell phone users do so gentlemen this seller not serious and are not victims like me.
+	I got phone that I wanted just not the filter and its great unlocked like i wanted and even came with the charger and head set
+	I've had this phone about a month now and there have been zero problems so far. It doesn't have as many apps as IPhone or Android but that's precisely why I chose this phone. Its simple, easy to use, yet with all the modern uses a smart phone should have. Plus its a Nokia, so I expect its gonna last me a while.
-	I got this phone on Oct. 2012 and was having a great time of it for about 8 months.  Last night, all of sudden I got the Black Screen and cannot get it power on, only the red led lights blink. I google it and found out it is called 'Black Screen of Death', which is a common issue for Samsung phone. I called customer services number on Samsung's website, give them the IMEI number and they said the phone is coming from Poland and I have to contact the Samsung in Poland's customer services.  I cannot speak or read Polish. I think I am stuck with a dead phone after 8 months of usage.  If any update of situation, I will followup with update. Good Luck !!!
-	after a month it started appearing the message ' câmera failed ' , and it never worked again ! Attempted to fix it at Samsung here in the US but they say it is not a US phone. WTF ! I bought it at Amazon.com, had it delivered to me at Orlando, FL .. Now that i spent almost 500 us dolars, can't use my phone ....
-	yo oferte el celular usado y me mandaron fue solo la caja con la guia deben de especificar mejor el producto que estan vendiendo, no voy hacer nada con la caja. ME ESTAFARONI bid the phone used and they sent me was just the case with the guidance should better specify the product you are selling, I will not do anything with the box. CHEATED ME
-	The phone cant be turned on now. The company (BLU) is making me jump through hoops to get it fixed under warranty.
-	I bought the cellphone from same seller but this second one was from canada so it didnt have all the language options the other one had. Seller didnt have any support info on how to add languages.
-	Started giving me trouble at the beginning of use, stopped working within days-weeks of use! Not worth buying, I wouldn't advice anyone to purchase this phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!
+	The phone was advertized as new but didn't seem to be when unboxed.But it works well.  The camera is very good and has all the features of a standalone 5mp point and shoot.It's android 1.6 and can't be upgraded as Samsung has declared it an orphan.But there's lots of apps for it on Android market.  Plays videos smoothly and the resolution is better than the low-end smartphones T-Mobile is selling.  Wifi is good, seems to have better range than low-end phones I've compared it to.Battery seemed to run down fast but I found a new battery for $4.00 and that seems to last a lot longer.  My impression that it was a used phone is now pretty sure.  There was no GPS app on it but a couple free ones on the Market work very well.
+	It is very user friendly.  I like it's sleek style and lightweight.  It is a good for a basic phone with a good price.
+	I got my palm Dixie phone and it arrived on time and in perfect condition!!!! I took this phone to my local Verizon and I was told that I need $400.00 deposit to start my phone. I don,t have $400.00. So I am stuck with this phone.
+	It's been good so far and was happy how fast I recieved it. It was very nice also... I will do it again
+	My niece wanted a phone for her 13th birthday so I got the Lumia 521.  She loved it!  I thought it may have been to advanced for her but it wasn't she quickly learned where things were and how to access what she needed.  She loved it and continues to thank me for her birthday gift.
-	I had an Iphone 4 before this one and it was great! I had it for about a year and then I dropped it. I needed a replacement phone and this seemed to be my best bet. The product claimed to be factory new. I had it working for a little over a month with a few hiccups which is usually normal with any phone. However, this one progressively got worse. It would shut its self off in the middle of calls, texts, apps, ect. Finally the phone shut its self off and would not turn back on. I fallowed all trouble shooting from apple and nothing worked. Today, I took it to Verizon (my wireless provider) and they told me that the phone was in fact refurbished, the battery was put in wrong and had started to corrode. They said it was fixable, but only for a hefty price. Needless to say, this is probably the worst thing I have ever bought and probably the worst company I have ever bought from. Please, I know it is cheap, but you could definitely do better else where!
+	I haven't used anything except texting and the phone but I absolutely Love it!!To add someone as a speed dial situation, you have to add them and then Pin them!It will show up on the very bottom of your Windows... I am still not used to this phone,but very classy cool indeed!!D
+	Good windows phone. I don't think it is bright enough, but that is okay for me. Good sound controls and camera.
+	This is a very good budget smart phone, it does not have a lot power like I phone or S4, but for less than $80.00 you have a solidsmart phone.
+	I dont know why this phone is so cheap. The only problem i have with windows phones is that i relized there apps arnt so great and they dont like google programs either. Cameras good and has many cool features. it was worth the price.
+	I've put off upgrading our family plan to smartphones for years because the prices were too high.  Either pay big bucks up front or pay an inflated monthly rate to offset the cost of the phone.  When T-Mobile introduced fixed bring-your-own-phone pricing I started hunting for an inexpensive Android phone but couldn't find a decent phone for under $300.  I knew from experience with my work phone that a cheap Android phone meant an undersized processor, last-gen OS, and endless frustration.  So I took a risk on the Lumia 521.  The app selection is pretty weak, but the basic features of the phone meet my needs.  Basic browser, maps, email/text, all at 4G speeds.  The processor seems to have plenty of oomph to keep things running smoothly.In the future I might pony up a few extra dollars for a nicer phone.  The plastic case on the Lumia's kind of flimsy, and the camera could use some work.  But at this price point I can break three of these phones and still be better off than if I'd bought a last-gen Samsung Galaxy.  Until I graduate to smartphone power user, the Lumia seems to be the best bang for the buck.
+	Wow, this phone really is easy to use compared to android phones I have had. It is simple to set up, just likeany other smart phone, but the operating system colors can be changed and the window are easy to understandand it is easy to add a contact. Not so with most android phones.
+	despite the fact that it is so lite weigh that you might think that it is one the china fake stuff, it a a very good phone.i have not been able to use it yet but i have played with it using the WiFi.i am still waiting for my sim cutter to arrive, yeah it uses micro so had to order one of the nano sim-cutter from amazon.
-	Not only do the apps suck but the phone itself is turning off on its own even with a full battery! Ugh!
+	I love the Nokia Lumia phones. This is my third one, and I bought one for my daughter. The Lumia 521 has basically the same features as newer ones, at a much more reasonable price. It has windows and wifi, so I can pick up signals at many locations as well as at home, so I don't need a data plan. I love how easy it is to customize, just drag the icons to the main screen and move around. Icons can be made big or small. Icons for individual frequently used numbers can be set with a photo, so easier to find. This is a fun phone. And I set the colors to match my daily outfit.
+	This is a great phone,price was great, it functions great, and no problems yet. Was already a T- Mobile customer, and switching to new phone was easy as a phone call to support. They did a great job with  the switch. Windows 8 is a change from Android to say the least, but so far a pleasant expierience.. Once again Amazon made my shopping task for new phone painless, thank's.
+	I previously used a Nokia Lumia 710 and really liked it, so I was familiar with the Lumia type Windows phone. I have no disappointment using this newer, windows 8 phone.Pros-1. solid phone for calls. no problems with poor connections or dropped calls after 3-4 weeks.2. surprisingly good camera. this phone has NO flash for the camera, but I've been surprised several times at how good the photos come out. I hold the phone up. Point it in the general direction of what I want to photograph. Push the button and I can now see my target lit up. I learned in photographing a recent snow shower that it has a slow shutter speed to allow more light in. My wife's photos from her camera were crisp with little flakes of snow. My pictures had long streak of snow.3. decent selection of apps. I am not a heavy app user, but I can find everything I've looked for except glide beta video messaging.4. this phone has significantly better voice recognition than my Lumia 710. I kinda miss the crazy humor of my phone trying to interpret my speech. It used to make for some really funny texts.5. Screen is not great but still very good.Cons-1. The phone will reboot randomly. It will reboot itself, similar to the old Microsoft blue screen of death from DoS days. Every 2-3 days, when I launch an app it shuts off and reboots.Still glad I have it. I am NPT a $400-$600 phone kinda guy. This is a great budget phone. I bought on Amazon for $79. It came with  a charger (2 actually- 1 longer to plug into included wall plug and a shorter one to use at the computer plugged into a USB port),  sim card (but I simply installed my old T-Mobile sim and it worked. Nothing else needed).It did not include an earpiece, case or any other accessories.
-	I live in Venezuela, and send me a CDMA phone and does not work in my country so I lost the money, plus the phone did not bring the s pen, really I am very disappointed in this purchase
-	I wanted a phone for calling and some texting. I don't really care about music, ringtones, videos, cameras, etc..First off, the physical layout befuddles me. I cannot stand having the 'voice recognition' and camera buttons where I am expecting the call and end buttons. I constantly press the volume up/down buttons on the side during use--I had my phone completely silent for the first week of ownership. The numeric buttons in general do not have a good feel, they  feel sluggish and unreliable.The software gets even worse. You know those three short cut keys on the top  half of the flip phone? Well, those are useless because you can only assign 9 pre-determined options to. You get things like pill reminder, alarm, tip calculator, and junk. You cannot set it to something like inbox or recent calls. Even worse is that once you press a shortcut button you need to confirm that is what you wanted to do.I'm used to predictive text on my Nokia. I press five keys and it tries to guess a five letter word. If it doesn't know it I can have the phone learn the word. On the Pantech Breeze if I press five keys it will try to guess four and six letter words before it even shows my legit five letter word. I don't know how to make it learn new words. It doesn't have the word 'scum' in it's dictionary.This phone attempts to do some kind of multitasking. If you go to a function that is considered an 'application' the phone will keep it in the memory unless you press the right key combination to fully exit it. If you don't the application stays in memory and eventually you'll get messages about not being able to more than 3 applications at the same time. There is no way to manage what applications are running unless you try to open more than three. Anything that is considered an application is useless, because they're things like email, instant messaging, and some kind of application manager. And I'm not sure what the application manager is, but it's never opened for me, it just sits there and twiddles it's thumbs. maybe it's download a bunch of stuff from the network or maybe it really doesn't do anything. Either way you lose.All of the games are 'trials' and over complicated.With that said, I would be able to look past all the negatives, except I have a hard time understanding what people are saying on this phone. I tried to have a conversation with my wife that consisted of me saying 'what' and 'excuse me' at least once in response to everything she said. On top of that I have been told that I am more difficult to understand on this phone. And for me this is the deal breaker. I needed a barebones phone that worked and this is not it.This phone is not worth the penny I paid. I am using AT&T.;
+	I like this phone compared to the android platform. Simple, easy to use and very friendly for anyone. I think its a great product.
+	Nokia Lumia 521 4G LTE  (T-Mobile) Nokia is one of the worlds finest cell phone producers in the world , they have always led in quality and performance , is the only phone from Finland that are perfectionist like all European products. The only flaw they had they maintained their operating system, which was quit good till android appeared in the picture, then they didn't get much help converting it into a windows phone, Bill Gates should make the Nokia's with both  operating systems . Now the good news , this phone has 22 updates as soon as you register it and for the price of $69.00 its upgraded to an 8.1 and now just about most of the best favorite android apps are  available at the  windows app store , which makes your phone better and faster integration with your computer, you have one of the best quality built phones for the price of 2 or 3 good covers for a galaxy 5 , 4g . In other words the best quality built phone is ready. Its the best for everyone that prefer a quality simple phone updated with better integration with computer.And has many unique features no other phone has. I just installed a 16GB card and it automatically accepted it without formatting it ,and asked if I wanted my pictures to go there automatically,I purchased 2 OEM batteries for 10 dollars you can switch them in 2 seconds, and they are quality Nokia not like some cheap Chinese ones, that drain supper quick.This a problem most consumers don't understand my Samsung drains the battery fast, yes its a cheap battery , I need to expand my memory and change my battery when its needed cause sometimes you cant wait to charge, then don't buy an iPhone the only company that makes you buy another phone for more memory ridiculous or send it to them a be without a phone when your battery is bad, thats why they are going down . Nokia rules they just need to add android as an option and  price, Quality,features.
-	Was not happy said it could be used with Verizon and it can not now i have a 700 dollar paper weight false advertisement
+	This phone is superb and a real testament to Nokia's greatness. Remember those old Nokia phones that everyone had in the 90's? You know, the ones that were great build quality and indestructible even though they were plastic? The ones that were so cheap it was easier to count how many of your friends DIDN'T have one? Well times have changed and we are in a smart phone world. Nokia almost died but they are once again making GREAT phones. This phone (and its 520 sibling on ATT) is a prime example.What is sooooo great about it you ask? Can a phone that I bought outright for $130 at the biggest discount chain in the world really be called GREAT? I believe it can, in the same sense that those old Nokia phones were GREAT.Those old Nokias were GREAT because they nailed 3 concepts. They nailed it on build quality, functionality for its intended purpose, and price. Let's compare these points one at a time.First up, they had GREAT build quality. Sure they were plastic and certainly weren't pretty but they were built solid and durable. I believe Nokia has done the same again with the Lumia 521. My experience tells me this phone is definitely solid and durable. About a day after I bought it I dropped it on a hard tile floor at a dept store. I didn't have a case or screen protector yet so I was really worried about my new phone. The back cover popped off and the battery flew out. The screen was face down. I picked it up and noticed the slightest dark scuff on the corner of the battery cover. I licked my finger and rubbed the dark scuff off. It was only dirt. To this day I can't find where that scuff was on the white cover. I did buy a case for it soon after but failed to buy a screen protector at the same time. I had the phone for about a month before I bought a screen protector. During that month I dropped it a few times. Each time the battery cover, case, and battery flew off. When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen. It looked like NEW! It didn't even have those little swirly micro scratches. I have since seen my screen protector get scratched (and self heal) multiple times and I have had it only about a week.Second, the old Nokia phones just worked and worked GOOD for basic functions. The Lumia 521 is for a new smart phone era and is required to do a lot more than the old Nokia bricks. But it does the basic smart phone functions very well. What are basic smart phone functions? Texting, email (multiple email services), Calendar (multiple online calendars), GPS navigation, Social Networks, Pictures, Music (streaming and local), Web, Most games, Phone and Speakerphone!!! Plus they are a lot more stable and less quirky than the Android alternatives, at least in my experience.Third, the old Nokias were cheap! Sure you could find other phones for the same price or cheaper but they failed miserably for build quality or basic functions. The Lumia 521 is a winner on this front. The total no-contract price you pay is cheaper than the on-contract down payment for a high end phone. It is cheaper than a month of service for many families and even some individuals. It hands down beats anything else for functionality at the price point. In fact I would rather have the Lumia 521 than a non-Lumia phone twice its price!Obviously I am enamored with my phone. Here are some things that surprised me about the Lumia 521:The camera: I really wasn't expecting much from the camera. I already had a Windows Phone 7.5 device with a 5 MP back side illuminated camera and a flash. I was expecting a downgrade because Nokia doesn't really claim anything special about the camera. And since there is no flash I thought it would be HORRIBLE. But I honestly like it better than the one on my previous phone. Nokia and MS have really done a good job with very little.The speakerphone: I have never owned a really high end phone but I have owned quite a few phones throughout the years, always getting a new one every 2 years at most. But the speaker volume and quality blew me away! I am very, very pleased! I have heard it isn't as good as a phone with BEATS audio but it sure blows away any other low to mid range phone my wife or I have owned in recent years.The touchscreen sensitivity: Nokia has done something really great with the touch screen on their latest smart phones, including the Lumia 521. They have introduced "Super Sensitive Touch" technology. What that means is you can use it with your gloves on. Now, I live in Texas and don't wear gloves in winter but I do ride a motorcycle and a bicycle. So I can just whip out my phone at a stop light and shoot off a quick text without taking my riding gloves off. Or I can mount it on the handlebar and easily use the GPS navigation or a fitness tracking app. I found that I get ghost touches sometimes with this feature turned on and I don't have gloves on. Fortunately, you can turn it off in settings when you know you won't be using it.Battery life: Windows phone has always touted good battery life. My HTC Radar 4G with WP7.5 lasted me the whole day most of the time, and that is saying a lot considering the intermittent signal I get in my work cubicle with all phones. When I first bought the Lumia 521 it had about the same battery life. But since the latest "GDR2" update the battery life absolutely ROCKS! I usually have about 40% charge left at the end of the day when I put it on the charger. My coworkers have to keep a charger at work with their Android phones.No SD card included: I consider this a good thing. This phone has a fair amount of built in memory and if you need more than that you most likely don't want the measly 2 or 4 GB card they would likely include with a low end phone like this. With this phone I don't have to pay for a card that I won't use. Instead, I can apply the money to a size that will meet my needs.All these things and more add up to the biggest bang for your buck in the smart phone world today. And for the price, you can afford to replace it if it gets lost, stolen, dropped in the pool, dropped in the toilet, dropped off a cliff, run over, vandalized, used as a hockey puck, slobbered on by your 1 year old, etc.  If you don't have one yet, go out and try one. You just might be surprised. If you have a high end phone, go out and buy one of these as a beater so you don't accidentally drop your precious $600 baby off the Ferris Wheel at the local fair. In conclusion, if you are reading this review you should probably just buy this phone and never look back.
+	I was skeptical about getting this phone because you usually get what you pay for.  Boy was I wrong.  This phone is awesome......I bought this for my gf and now I am thinking of selling my Galaxy to get one of these............SOLID PHONE 4 SURE
-	Do not buy this phone you will be disappointed to say the least I have had nothing but trouble since I have had this phone it is a waste of money.
+	I have had this phone for 2 months now and absolutely love it!!  Had no problem activating it with Kitty Wireless/Page Plus system.  Was new in box with all accessories.  Would buy again from this vendor...
-	The phone was put in a generic box. The USB charger and USB cable is not PALM brand. They are generic also. And without ear plus. The USB inlet of phone was lacerated.
+	Full disclosure: I have had to return/exchange phone twice, but I still give it 5 stars.  Here's why:-Love the way Windows phone's OS is set up.  Very easy, convenient, manageable and easy to set up the way I want to tailor it to my needs.-I've had excellent battery life with it, although I carefully manage WiFi, Bluetooth, location services and usage, etc.  It's easy.-I used Nokia's complimentary "set-up service," where you make an appointment and they call you (preferably on a separate line) to discuss things you don't understand with the phone.  I waited a few days to explore the phone myself, so as to hopefully have some "intelligent" questions, and it was a pleasure.  Although you categorize the areas you want to discuss, you're free to ask whatever you like, so you can effectively use your phone.  The Nokia representative was efficient, knowledgeable and friendly - i.e., real customer service.  And they said I was free to call any time as a Nokia owner.  Nice!-Although the 521 lacks a couple of things that would be nice, such as a magnetometer for true location services, a front-facing camera, etc., with my provider, T-Mobile, it has several advantages, such as WiFi calling.  I bought this phone specifically to replace my old Nokia E-series and to use with T-Mobile's so-called "Wal-Mart Plan."  $30/month, 100 minutes of calling, unlimited text and data (up to 5gb at 4g) - perfect for me.As for the returns, the first was likely not the phone but the SIM card.  Nonetheless, T-Mobile suggested returning all and starting fresh.  I considered that solid advice.  Second, probably a battery, but again, with the sane advice of Nokia, they suggested a complete reset.  I will say this, the recovery was much less painful with Nokia/MS Windows phone's OS than I expected.  If you log in via an MS account, and allow them to save/update your system, such occurrences (which happen with all variety of phones!) is not so painful.I recommend, but again, I'm NOT an apple fan, nor much of an Android fan, either.Bottom line: Find another phone with this much functionality and utility for this price point.  You can't, in my book.
+	I like this phone.  It's user friendly and fun to use.  Takes good enough pictures and videos.  You can find lots of apps comparable to apple apps.  Battery life is good enough for the amount of processing the phone does.  I charge it every other day.  Only has about 7GB storage so you need at least a 16 GB SD card for phone updates, photos, videos etc.
+	after looking around and checking some other note 3 for the price this one is worth the buy if your'e looking for a clone best part is that the phone is unlocked for almost every carrier with mines i plan on using h20 or straight talk haven't picked yet but might lean towards h20 just to test the network. either way great price for a note 3 clone really can't tell them apart.
-	so,so prepaid  phone freezes a lot ,people hard to hear you on the other end.shouldnt even got this, on the description says pay as you go 20 cents a minute as you get charged only when you make calls which I like, why I wanted it. .NO MORE! ITS EITHER $2.00 A DAY UNLIMITED OR  $50.00 A MONTH.sometimes I don't even use the phone for a day and i'm getting charged $2.00, donating this phone, don't want it, waste of $30 bucks!
-	Ok so this is my second straight talk phone I recently had the Samsung galaxy proclaim that I had bought for a crisp 180 with tax, so this phone seemed like a good buy it had the latest android Os and the price tag was good. A few of the specs differed yeah.  Well let's start from the reception when I was at home I would get perfect signal. I leave and go to work and it was always in and out of service. Now here recently it refuses to pick up or even notice any wifi including my home wifi .... I did a restore on it.. that did nothing but take away all my apps.. I've had this phone less than a week and it's already acting up?? I warn against this phone. Btw don't try to take your phone back to walmart to Ryan to get a replacement or a refund they will not do it.
+	Love this phone.  I bought this phone as an experiment to see if I could get used to a Windows 8 phone and all I can say is that it exceeded my expectations by far.  Not only am I impressed with the hardware, but I'm also impressed with the operating system.  The phone itself works great:  very smooth and responsive.  The features work flawlessly every time.  Nokia has done a great job in producing such a great phone at such an affordable price.  Also, they packed the phone really cool features.  The only drawbacks on the phone is that it has no flash for the camera and no forward facing camera for Skyping; but those are small details I willing to live with.  Microsoft really did a great job with the operating system.  By the way, transitioning to this phone took no time at all. Nokia included an app that allows you to move all your contacts and pictures to the phone in just a matter of minutes.  It is very intuitive and easy to use. I highly recommend.
-	I had this unit for about two months when it quit working.  I tried to return it to Amazon but they said I had missed the return date and would not take it back, so much for Amazon's return policy.  Other then that I called the service provider and was told that there were a lot of complaints about this phone and that they would not recommend it.
-	The phone stopped working after 50 days.I supsect it is a software issue because it shows the first "BLUE" screen, and then it just stays there for forever...I do not recommend this item.
+	Great phone over all. Fast and user friendly. The mega pixel amount is the only bad thing about this phone. Never owned a smart phone, but I'm glad I went with a windows phone. You should be warned that Android Apps will not work on this phone and that the Windows versions of the same apps aren't completely the same. That doesn't bother me at all.
+	Its good for the most part.I ordered 3 but one of them had a battery issue and i didnt purchase the warranty so i'll have to buy a battery replacement for it.details: battery wont charge sometimes so i have to jiggle it until its in the right position. phone dies to the slightest bump - taking the battery out and back in usually fixed this until the next time i bumped my phone.Another slight problem is that where i live, i dont have very good cellular internet speeds, but its ok because i can just use the wifi.no other problems to report so far
+	I bought this phone directly thru Amazon with no contract obligation for under $100, and as many other reviewers have noted, it represents an excellent value with comparable features to other smart phones costing 5-6 times more.  It is lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy.  Good size screen, above average battery life, good camera quality (5MP), quick response time to prompts, excellent speaker quality, all the essential apps one should realistically need or probably use, and all for under $100!  What else is there to say?  If you'd rather spend 5-6 times more so you can keep up with the Jones', go for it.  If, however, you're like me and rather use the savings for more essential needs and not be under a 2 year contract, then the Nokia Lumia 521 is a no brainer.  Major kudos to Amazon for their tremendous price on this super phone and Prime for quick shipping/delivery!
-	Most dropped calls I have ever had. Did not buy this from Amazon but I felt I needed to say something. Had to remove the battery once a day to use any apps or to get on the internet. Any game sites even provided for from get stuff said no games available.
-	I ordered this phone and it got to me fine but when I put together it asked me to activate in Brazilian language. So be careful what you buy in Blu cell phones you might get this type of phone. I returned it cannot use it in USA!
+	THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME. IM NOT SURE IF IT IS 4G BUT ITS SCREEN IS GREAT AND STRONG. THE INTERNET IS OK AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PHONE IS AWESOME. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE !!!
+	This is a decent phone for the money. Do not buy a non US version of this phone, you will not be a happy camper it you reside here. The only real thing this phone is lacking is a flash for the camera, other than that it has all the rest of the normal smartphone functions. Really nothing else compares to a Windows Phone. You can have your Apple's and Android's, I will never go back. You want a Windows Phone, especially if you use your phone for any business activities. Simply the best, Office already there, Skydrive auto upload feature of all your pictures so they are immediately backed up. Manages multiple email accounts with ease. All your contacts and everything linked to your Microsoft account so if you loose or break your phone, they are still their. Simple, easy to use, never continual updates like with iPhones that seem to take hours. Longest update will be the first time you plug it in and get the software current. After that, maybe a five minute update once a year. I highly recommend any Windows Phone made by Nokia or Samsung. I am still using a 3 year old Focus Flash that has hit the ground so many times I can't even count anymore. Swimming in mud holes, dropped from two stories up onto concrete, flies into pieces. Pick up the pieces and put it back together again just like Humpty Dumpty. I will say the one thing I look for is a metal case like my Focus Flash has, they last longer. This one cannot handle falls like that one can but it is a whole lot cheaper and wont break the bank if you break it.
+	For those that need Good.com and Lync 2010, they work and work better than on Android. I am selling my Nexus 4 and staying with the Nokia 521. I don't need the 925 camera or screen resolution, the 521 screen is fine and sound is incredable. The 521 is a great phone and has options that are not on the 925. It is always easier to use, yesterday I was on a bridge call and added another phone connection to the bridge call... surprise, we have support here on the bridge! KeePass/7Pass sync works with Drop Box, but not Sky Drive. TuneIn radio is there along with Nokia's music. XMSirius is not. You can put in a 64GB micro SD card and have a backup battery, those are the 2 important options not on a 925. There is the Desktop Sync tool that you can install on your PC to synchronize photos and music.Skinomi TechSkins are the best, they even sent me a second complementary set for my Nexus 4!SoundMAGIC E10M - the M means a microphone... You will not believe the sound for the price! My SoundMagic does not work with microphone for the Windows phone, no problem with the Nexus 4. Not sure it it's SoundMagind, butEtymotic hf2 does work... it requires a good seal to get the base, the E10M doesn't require such a good seal, but helps.7PASS works great when it's database is stored on Drop Box, it does not work with Sky Drive... know problem admitted by the developer. 7PASS works with KeePass.Conference Calleague works great to dial into conference calls and enters passcode. I copied GOOD calendar items that are conference meetings into Outlook calendar. This would not be necessary if I could establish conferences through Good.Wells Fargo and Fidelity apps are in the store... Citibank card is getting a lot less use.SiriusXM does not have an app and there is no Flash for IE, so you can't use it.Nokia Music is great.Tunein Radio is there so you can listen to NPR.TechNet radio is cool.There aren't as many apps as the competition, but the ones that really count are there and they work great.Data Sense and Flixster are also among my favorites.I can't believe how responsive Dropbox is. SkyDrive can take a long time to sync to find your files on another device.Hope this helps.EDIT:It turns out that SoundMagic Headphones mic does not work on Nokia Lumia 521. I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925. Lync is impressive and it's an app I really appreciate, works well on both phones.I upgraded to a 925 on T-Mobile Jump plan. The SoundMagic headphones are that good, add a great display (yes, it's a noticeable difference when not side by side) and wireless charger... I'm happy with the 925.
-	This phone works very slowly and it gliches .. i am with t-mobile and out of no where my phone was put on reverse and my messages started sending backwards , idk how to take it off so now I'm stuck with a stupid phone , but that's what happenes when you pay a small price for a big phone ..
+	I am very pleased with this purchase, we are currently trying to find a case to fit the phone. This was a gift for my teenage daughter and she is in complete love with this phone. Score big for Mom!
-	This phone is extremely slow. Freezes up so often... unable to make calls or send messages. .. Unable to hear the other party.... so many issues with this phone.
+	I've been using smart phones for a while,have used HTC 4g (android), Motorola & othersthis is my first Windows phoneEXCELLENTexcept for front camera, this phone has everything most smart phones offerin the price here?? MOST DEFINITELY GREAT VALUEHighly Recommend
+	The  phone i purchased works great.I am  very happy with poduct. I am glad i got the pbone from here.
+	The only thing I am worried about? Well it work with Striaght talk that's my only concern about it.Can anybody give me any info on this please talk soon
+	This is a very fast, good looking phone. And for the price its fantastic but the price comes at a price. The lack of front facing camera is inconvenient because I wanted to get into snap chat, al so the back cover gets loose over time if you don't use a case and can make it feel flimsy and cheap. But if you can get over that its wonderful. Very nice screen and very good touch capabilities. Also good sound with loud speakers and is very light. Overall a very nice phone for the price.
-	Switched from iphone to this, very bad choice. Poor camera, can't get picture messages, crashes when people call me, nytimes app doesn't work if you don't have service at the time.
-	This phone sucks!! It says its unlocked for ATT and T-Mobile but it is only for att  and is only a 2g phone.
+	When it comes to phones, I've had flip phones to slider phones, from the G1 to the Double play, and have owned nearly every brand and generic brand phones, so when i speak YOU should listen. With that being said, my husband and I were looking for budget phones till we get a GS4 at the end of the year, and stumbled on the Lumia 521. Our preference is to Android phones, as the majority of the phones we've had were android, so we instantly bypassed this phone because it was a Windows powered phone. After much painstaking searching, we were bummed. No budget 4g phones to buy and all arrows were pointing to this one. So began countless hours of research, reviews, and more reviews. We finally just said screw it and purchased two 4g Lumia 521's. Unpacking the phone was a joy and as we soon discovered, Windows 8 was the undiscovered jewel. First of, this phones dual-core processor and 512mb of RAM wouldn't make it very far in the Android world, but here it's snappy and responsive, no lag experienced and apps run smoothly. Secondly, this phone is the first phone we've ever had that allowed us to delete the slew of bloatware with a simple click. No more worries of rooting a phone just to be able to uninstall unwanted apps. Thirdly, while the main screen doesn't allow for much customization, you can change the apps on the live tile and change the color of the tiles as well. Fourthly, the phone has an amazing battery compared to other phones. Putting the battery saver on the setting "always on (not recommended)" preserves the battery. I'm not sure why it states it's not recommended to not have the battery saver on this setting, but we experienced two days on a single charge of light use! To maximize battery, set brightness to low, put automatic brightness on, and download a battery saver off of the Windows Store. Speaking of the store, we had heard that the Windows app store was incredibly small. Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps. But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free. With that being said, we found the W8 store to be plentiful with USEFUL apps, full of graphically cool games, and several jaw-dropping downloads that would cost money in the Android world. We rate this phone 10 out of 10 and would recommend it to all. On a side note, there is indeed hotspot/tethering on here, even though it's stated there is none. The on-screen keyboard works extremely well and the letters are nicely spaced out making two-hand typing more friendly.Pros:Awesome batteryGreat keyboardSnappy processorWindows Live TileTetheringGreat AppsLightweightResponsive ScreenAwesome Nokia Music AppCons:No LTE, which may be deal breaker for some, we really didn't careApp store may not have same apps as android, again no one has room for every single android app, let alone uses more than 20 apps IMHOLimited Main menu customization (tile color can be changed)
-	I received the phone packaged ok. I have found it not working properly. It comes on looking like its ok but then it sometimes don't allow calls to be made or to swipe the unlock on the screen. Then as the phone is turned on and goes into standby mode then it will not turn back on unless you take the battery out then start it over again and again. Im out of money and ended up purchasing another cell phone replacement which means I've lost twice the amount of money as well as being inconvenienced.
+	This is a great phone for the price. It's smooth and easy to use, wont give you much problems; recommended.
-	I am not satisfied with the device, sent me a Chinese team, you can not upgrade in Venezuela and the battery is generic, and Att when the publication did not provide that feature
-	I just upgraded my Straight Talk account to this phone. I've endured multiple operating system crashes...inability of phone to maintain correct time of day...and worse....phone cannot keep track of it's current location. I live in St. Augustine Florida...the phone's default location seems to be Tallahassee FL...200+ miles west of me.It's kind of hard to locate a movie @ Redbox...when you are in St. Augustine, and am only seeing rental machine in Tallahassee.If I ask google about my location...it says brings up a map of Tallahassee.Per Straight Talk...the phone is working normally...Really??? A Smart Phone that doesn't know where it's at???I'm not sure if it is a phone issue...a straight talk issue or what...but it is not a real workable situation.I'm
+	So the three phones I was most seriously considering: Google Nexus 4, LG Optimus L9 and Nokia Lumia 521. I decided to cross off the Nexus from the list purely based on price. I am just not ready to invest that much in a phone, this purchase was going to be my first smartphone. I ordered the L9 for my dad off amazon and waited to finally get a Lumia at Walmart. So I have had a chance to play with both of them.My uses for a phone: Talking, Texting, GPS, Playing Music, Light browsing (yelp, looking up restaurants, etc)Overall, I do like/love the Nokia.1)It's light, interface is clean. The layout and the ease of setting up everything is great. Lot of nice customization.2) Lumia feels solid. Feels good in the hand.*Compared to L9 - L9 looks a LOT sleeker, but also maybe slightly more fragile? L9 felt thinner, but felt better than the Lumia - better back.3) One big reason, I picked the Nokia is the maps/navigation can be used offline. So I thought that would be a cool feature.4) The sound is great, all apps run well. Videos on youtube played great, music sounds good, decent selection of apps. I installed all the apps I would want, and they all work well. Camera is adequate- nifty camera button on the side, so if you need to activate your camera quickly, you can launch it pretty fast.So those are some of the positives, and the positives are GOOD. Some gripes I have:1) In the GPS: There is no step by step directions list. Here Drive is in Beta, so I am hoping they will add it, but I don't know. The GPS will take you from point A to point B, BUT...I like to preview steps. A moderator's response to someone with a similar question:"We might implement a list of directions in the future, but we would also like to know why you need them if you are going to get voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation anyway: isn't the map overview enough? If you miss the list so much, you can always calculate the route first on Nokia Maps and from there start the Nokia Drive navigation"I did try that and it does work, only thing is, switching isn't as convenient as if there is a button that would just pull up the direction list. This reason alone, I am debating whether to keep it or not, I really like the phone though. And the GPS works fine otherwise, voice navigation.*GPS in the L9 does not have this problem, and seemed to be fine - also there is a voice input for destination in the L9. The Lumia can get around that (to an extent) by an app called "Go to" which you need to install but it's FREE!2) No Swype - which I knew beforehand, but texting with both phones: swyping with L9 felt more comfortable. Although I think it's just that I have to get used to typing on an onscreen keyboard (I am coming from a physical one, though I have used swype on friends' phones). And I have only had the 521 for 2 days, and it's getting better. The word predicting thing is already getting pretty accurate. So that's a plus.3) No front camera - I also knew this beforehand, but the L9 has it, and I think it would come in handy, gchat/skype all that good stuff, it would be nice to have.Final Thoughts: Sorry this was long, but I wanted to include as much as possible. L9 is probably the better phone (and only for a bit more - buy through amazon or HSN), but I really like the Nokia (almost love) only thing that's holding it back for me is really the step by step direction list. I just feel a lot more comfortable with that, if someone is giving me directions when I'm driving, I always ask what's after that...ok what's after that. So man. I am on the fence, but leaning towards keeping it.One thing I didn't get to test between the phones is battery life. No comment as of yet on that. Everything else works well. If the final version does have a direction list this would be a 4.5 star phone for me. Crossing fingers. Without it, a 3.5 to 4. It's a good phone (regardless of price, but with price great), once you start playing around with it, you'll really like it, and maybe fall in love.
+	phone for my girlfriend for Christmas. haven't used it much personally but she loved it and thanks me practically every day for it. I will admit that this phone, being a windows phone, can't download certain apps here and there that you could normally get on a normal android/iPhone, but usually there isn't any problems, and it's a nice phone nonetheless
+	The phone is well laid out, and the Windows OS works fine.One caveat.  There are many accessories advertised for the Lumia 521 that don't fit it.  Some that say for 520 and 521 also, don't usually fit the 521.
+	its my first windows phone it is best :) . i had white color and its perfect :)  touch screen works perfectly.
-	The pair of "unlocked" cell phones were purchased for family members living outside of the United States.  To my surprise, coverage for the cell phones were unable to be added for each of the devices.  When purchasing the cell phones my query on Amazon, I requested "unlocked" cell phones, but unfortunately, the cell phones did not function outside of the USA.
+	Actually I had bought this Nokia Lumina 521 last year and made the mistake to return it.  After having several high end smart phones, I just re-purchased it again.  Mainly because of Microsoft windows and price, and because everything works so well and simple.  Good battery life, nice clear screen and can hear conversations nice and clear too but most importantly, it has WiFi calling which most phones don't offer it with T-Mobile.  Although I have several android tablets, IPad, and windows tablet, I always seem to like the Windows program better except for the lack of apps. I recommend this phone.
-	I bought this phone and the first one wouldn't work, talk to the company and the got another phone, the new phone just came in and it doesn't work. I would not buy this phone at all. Save your money...
-	I bought this phone in January. Recently that touch screen has completely stopped working, I suspect it was the cause of the random freezes and restarts I had started to see about a month ago too which I though was software related but factory resets didn't help. Samsung USA won't support this phone, they are apparently clueless on it and direct you to its country of origin in my case UAE (can be anywhere... India, Bulgaria, etc.) even though it was still manufactured like all the others in Korea. So after talking to Samsung in UAE they want me to ship it there for any type of warranty support which won't be cheap or fast.I had faith in Samsung but this recent failure of them to be able to support an "International" phone internationally has given me second thoughts. The reason I purchased this phone was so I could use it while traveling, which worked great.
-	I never received the phone; I wondered about a couple of other reviews citing delays or retuned money but some customers sounded satisfied so I took a chance,as the phone I paid for was new and only $400--too good to be true. I emailed the seller who assured me he or she had had some shipping difficulties but planned to mail my phone at 4pm that day.  When I checked the "Your item has shipped" notification, there was no Tracking #. Sure enough, several days later I received another notification about my $$ being refunded..which did happen ok. So what was that all about? Stolen phones? Someone scamming to have "borrowed $$" to use for a few days? Who knows; I'm just glad I got my money back without a hassle
+	Let me start by saying that shipping of the phone came extremely fast. I definitely was not expecting to recieve my new phone as quick as i did. Only took about 3days to get here. Not what im used to in the past when buying phones online. Second, going from an android phone to a windows was definitely not a hard change at all. I actually find the windows phone very easy with all of the setups. The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one. I unexpectedly was not ready for that. But other than that. I have no complaints. Looking forward to getting new cases and exploring more on my new Nokia Lumia Windows 8 phone. Thanks Microsoft and Amazon.
+	My $385 Nexus 5 phone can't do some of the stuff this phone is capable of doing. It is of the familiar Windows environment (as opposed to the way things work in Android), and it seems that the new features were added to make it very user friendly. It is different than Android and takes time to get used to, but it is a joy to discover new settings on this phone. It does not have hundreds of thousands of apps similar to Google’s Android, but I don't need all those apps - I only use a few favorite apps that are readily available.I am really impressed at the speed, user friendliness, cost, and features of this phone and defiantly recommend it.
+	This is my first smartphone.  I love it so far.  I could not send and recieve pictures on it so  I called tmobile and was told to take a picture and send it to my number.  I did and after that I was able to send and recieve pictures.  The camera takes great shots outside or in bright light but there is no flash.  Over all it seems like a good phone at a good price.
-	My primary problem is that i seem to have one of the bad ones that reboots. As near as i can tell, its because the battery is losing contact upon shock, or even a gentle squeeze in your hand. I have other issues, too, which I'll list, but this first one is the deal breaker, everything else is just for information purposes for others.CONS.The capacitance of the screen is too high for me. I have been using the touch features, but the sensitivity is so great, i've 'floated' my finger near the screen without touching, and the phone counted it as a touch.The camera's LUX/low light sensitivity is TERRIBLE. Pictures indoors after dusk will be all but useless without major ambient light.It also has no notification LED to let you know if a txt is waiting, and the Windows buttons are not back-lit and impossible to see in the dark.Apparently, the hardware for the sound in this phone is a budget chip that has no hardware supported features like DSP and EQ. No app exists for EQ of sound either. Thats really sad considering even cheap Symbian phones from Nokia of before could do that. This phone even uses the same battery as the Nokia Nuron.I didn't realise how much i miss a 'click' vibrate when typing a touch keyboard. this phone does not have such a thing.At least half of the phones STOCK functions do not tilt into horizontal mode, including the navigation map, this is highly annoying. Also, generally speaking, the phone's UI is a bit difficult to navigate without looking directly at it. I noticed this while driving that i could operate my previous phone without looking at it and not have to look away from the road.There is also a general design paradigm problem I have with Windows Phone as a platform.This phone's UI flys in the face of 30 years of cellphone design. when the phone rings, most phones offer a green answer button, and a red hangup/goto VM button. not Windows phone. the answer button takes on the colour of whatever 'theme' colour you've set.The Modus operandii as I have come to find in using WP is that Microsoft wants you to replace/overwrite existing programs, accounts, and apps that you use in an effort to unify your experience in WP.  This is so that Microsoft can link all of your activities together in order to track your usage habits more accurately. This is basically the same as Google forcing people to create a Google+ account in order to be allowed to use Youtube features.The goal of both companies is the same, to track your habits and use the data for marketing. No matter how anonymous Microsoft and Google assure me such info gathering is, and that it is forced compliance to use their technology, doesn't mean I like it.example: the Skype app for WP rejects any existing accounts you have and wants you to create a new account with Microsoft. only then are you permitted to 'link' your existing account to the newly forced Microsoft account.this process serves Microsoft far more than it serves you as a user, because Microsoft now ties all your usage of Skype to all your other activities online to build more usable profile about your habits.If you install an SD card, WP wants to 'sync' your data with a backup cloud and refuses to simply browse the contents of the card. There is no 'file manager' to browse the contents of an SD card.  The WP system is setup so that all apps can only access their own storage thats set aside. While this has the potential to greatly increase security, the way its implemented completely hamstrings what most think to be a very common phone feature. Even 3rd party file managers that you may download are restricted by WP to not allow access to a 'music' or 'document' folder on your SD card.Many applications that came with the phone demand location services that have no business needed to know where you're at.  Calender, games, help & tips, and others.that being said, the system isn't bad, but it isn't for everyone. if you've already given in to super integration and forced compliance with tracking, you won't care even a little bit about what I've pointed out.EDIT:Additional problems have appeared. For one, even when it has full connectivity with 4g coverage, it REFUSES to connect to service until I disable the connection (airplane mode or reboot) and reconnect it. This only affects voice service, data still functions perfectly, leaving me to think its not a service issue.also, the voice to text feature requires network access to work. That means they are downloading every voice to text message you make, analysing it remotely and sending you back what they think you said.  That means they're keeping every recording you make...
-	I bought this phone for my daughter for Christmas.  Had it 6 months and it started turning itself off all the time.  Then it wouldn't charge.  Showed the charging icon but battery wouldn't charge.  I sent it in for repair and they returned it saying the wouldn't fix it under warranty because it "showed damage that isn't covered under Nokia limited warranty."  The form letter didn't explain what the damage was or what was covered under warranty.  I will never buy another Nokia product again.
+	The setup was harder then expected but other then that it is awesome. If has lots of good apps to use
-	Sucks, just a big phone for nothing. It say 4g on the box it comes in. But it only have 3g network. It's ok for the price. But not for it to be used on a serious level. This phone is a dead end for me.
+	bought this for my daughter to replace a T mobile phone that died. although I don't have any first hand knowledge of usage, she's pretty happy with the phone. and it would seem to have many features of higher priced phones.
+	Very nice phone.  Missing a few features like flash for the camera and message reminder, but it is the low end model.  Love the Windows Op system.  Very simple and very fast.  I can sync my Outlook calendar and contacts and mail with my PC.
+	Got the phone in about 3 days and it looks like it has never been touched. graphics is pretty well done for the phone and it flows pretty well with the windows system. Battery life isn't long if you plan to game and such but overall pretty well done
+	I have nothing bad to say about the phone, it does every thing i need it to do. its real easy to use
+	The phone is excellent. Windows 8 is a great OS.Excellent value for money. I would recommend this phone to everyone.
-	The phone is a nice concept, but it is NOT designed for the U.S. market.  We had several problems, and LG's technical support in the U.S. refused to provide any help.  No manual was included with the phone (had to search for one on-line and download it), and the charger was a European-style plug, not suitable for the U.S.  Without support for the problems, the phone became worthless.  At least Amazon agreed to a refund.  The seller should be penalized by Amazon for trying to sell a European product in the U.S., where support is unavailable.
-	This phone is horrible. It has horrible reception, and the advertisers lied about the amount of RAM. I found it to be 254 mb, when it was claimed to be 512. Also, they claim to have 4G of internal memory, but the phone only has 512 mb of ROM. The operating system is a mix between 2.3 and 4.1, but can't be distinguished as one or the other, but one thing is for sure; It's not 4.1. Please, follow my advice and look for another phone, hopefully I will be the last to make such a horrible decision.
+	Although, it was a last minute purchase my main phone broke. I thought it was a great way to get into windows phone 8. This phone is great fluid, and simple. I loved it and for the price it's a well solid built phone. It's a real trooper, dropped it, kicked it been to hell and back and still chugging along.
+	Ordered it for a friend and she loves it works great and no problems works with my service provider and im in The Bahamas.
+	Yeah, this is the entry level smartphone that you always wanted, good quality, good picture taking resolutions, lots of feature to use and play with, don't spend no $600 for the phone and making payment forget it honey, no way José!
-	I was happy with this phone, but it has 4 dead pixels. Looks horrible. Its sad. I paid 600 dollars for this
-	The one star is for the combination of my ordering and product appearance experiences.1  First, I ordered a new one and they sent me an used one.  After my complaint to Amazon on the phone, I was asked to return the product and they asked me to order another one.  As a result, I paid 127.49 in my second purchase instead of 199.99 origianally paid.  I got a one day shipping free.2. The second one was new.  It works good but the phone has a defect that the metal (could be plastic) frame around the screen has a chip that cannot be repaired.3. The phone was not preloaded with WhatsApp & Youtube as promised in advertisement.I am still not able to have time to test all function of the phone.  However, phone call, email, and messaging functions seem to work OK.
+	for the price..its awesome! the camera can be a bit better but its still not that bad. gets my thumbs up!!
+	The purpose of this review is note the value added from this phone with respect to Zune HD and X-Box Music. In addition, I wanted to note that as I am using it as my personal media device, I can monitor the T-mobile reception.Currently, I have a ZuneHD 32GB that is attached to my X-box Music subscription which allows me to download my music and listen to them monthly without WiFi, although I never purchased them. I would periodically need to connect to a network to show that I am still a subscriber, but it works great. For those that are trying to do what I am doing, make sure that you download the song to the phone (and do not buy).As you can see, these devices are no longer supported and they have aged. This is where this phone comes into play. This device natively plays my protected music. I expanded the data with a 32GB microSD card. In result, I found a replacement ZuneHD, which is supported (+), with more memory storage (+), a decent camera (+), Microphone for WiFi Calls (check out the apps), and has a speaker. This device is more responsive and is cheaper than when I bought my Zune media player. I can check out YouTube and surf the web better my previous device.Just with the noted features above, I give it a five. So there is also the phone portion of the device.I do not have the service. I did not know if it would work in location that I would need it given the complaints that I have seen on the web. Well, without the service but with the SIM card attached, I can still monitor the signal strength! I have a minimum of 2 bars of 4G on where I need it. I look forward in using it in the future.Finally, for those that have an android phone with all their contacts stored in google, this phone syncs up with it!I have been completely impressed with this phone for the price. It is smooth.In result, the value of this phone is way more than what it is being sold. It is a great Zune/Xbox music player, with the ability to use wifi and surf the web. It is a phone, if I choose to use it that way.*UPDATE 11/6/2013*I am now using it as a phone. I am an android user and I am impressed with Windows Phone 8. It synced up with my Google contacts. Predictive texting is the best that I have seen (with auto-correct). I can now sync my Zune/Xbox Music. I think this would be a GREAT first time Smart Phone user phone. The learning curve is nothing.The drawbacks now that we are using the phone is that:1. MS Xbox Music wants to "sync" online when playing music so you will see a HARD lag with the phone. This makes me want to upgrade to a faster phone with more ram to see if this gets corrected.2. The 8 GB memory gets used up fast even though I requested everything to be placed on my SD card. It appears to be a flaw with windows phones in general.I still think this is an amazing phone for the price.
-	How can l get the phone replaced ...have a 1 yr warrenty on it....quit working ....sound went out...thank you sandra.
-	beautiful phone , but one  giant piece of crap. nothing works.  my last problem was  that  the headphone will be on and the speaker will be on too.
+	I was charged with finding a non-contract smartphone replacement for my mother in-law. I obviously researched this carefully, lest I be in the dog-house. I read these reviews and decided to order this Lumia 521, not expecting a great success because of the low-price. I was blown away by the scaleable functionality (it can be as simple or as complicated as one configures). Battery life, call quality, apps, all of the things that the other reviewers here have explained better than I could.All I can say is it suits all ages, and technical levels. My mother in-law has one, my father in-law (previously a flip-phone user, and 85 years young) and I have one now. The Lumia satisfies all needs at all levels and does so beautifully well. As to the cost, I don't believe one could even buy a stolen iPhone for this price.A caveat regarding the battery! The Lumia uses a Li Ion battery, and not a NiCad battery. If you run down this Li Ion battery it will not have enough energy left to power it's integral chip, and it will never function properly again, if at all. It should not be 'conditioned' as the NiCads needed; the Ni Cads developed a sort of memory, and thus had to be conditioned - exhausted then recharged completely a number of times to ensure it's life. This one needs constant energy, and is also sensitive to heat.So, when you get this phone, the battery is often partially charged out of the box. Plug it in, charge it until it says full (a couple of hours max) and then remove it from the charger. After using the phone, charge it when it tells you to (about 11% remaining). Try not to leave it plugged in to a charger when you are using it, as it will also shorten battery life. This way it should give you about 2-3 years service before it dies. The Lumia also has a great app management function to stop apps draining (most free apps drain batteries a lot) and a superb battery saver function that will stop  apps working in the background until they are used again.
-	A piece of crap.  Battery doesn't last long, windows has almost zero apps to download compared to android or iPhone, has no front camera or flash, even camera is blurry, already twice my touchscreen will just stop working completely until I take the battery out for an hour or more, if your battery dies and you put it on the charger then it won't turn back on for 10-15 mins like most phones will let you.Don't waste your money seriously.
-	This is the worst cell phone I have ever purchased or attempted to use.  The voice quality is poor: muffled and weak, and the battery life is absymal.  While Pantech rates standby time as ten days I have been unable to get more than two days before the battery quickly dies, even with no talk time and with all the displays set on minimum. A second battery was same as the first and Pantech "suport" told me there's nothing they can do about the battery life.  Stay away!  Even if you get this "free" you will be very unhappy and dissatisfied.
+	It does not hold a charge  and when on charger seems to start to beep that the charge is done already within a very short few minutes.
-	The phone comes in german language and you have to switch it.  Then it worked for one day and then it SHUT DOWN completely even though it was fully charged.  I threw away the box so can't return it.  Spend more and get some quality, This seller is selling obviously suspect items.  Of course, I noticed that items that are sold by a third party and processed by Amazon should RAISE A RED FLAG.
+	Some phone carriers cannot unlock the phone to be activated. The one company that could do this, still cannot service the phone from tech support. But overall, the phone does the normal functions. Make calls, send texts and browse the internet.
-	I love the look of this phone. It's compact, attractive, stylist. The swipe features are also really nice and I've found this phone to be relatively easy to use. My Google contacts synced right up and within minutes the phone was ready to go. Tomorrow it's going back to Amazon.Here's why:-The phone runs hot. And not just a little warm, or a lot warm, it's hot. So hot it was uncomfortable and I tried to hold the phone by its sides when I used it.-When charging, the phone got even hotter. I'm not joking when I'm saying it burned my hand. I'm wondering, now that the phone is packed and ready to go back, if my unit was defective. Because if a lot of people experienced this, they're either ignoring it or they don't know how unusual it is for a phone to get that hot.-My Yahoo! mail wouldn't sync. I kept getting an error. I deleted the account and set it back up 4 times.-The battery life is terrible. The first day it lasted almost 6 hours and I hooked it up for an hour, after which it lasted for another hour.-The second day the battery lasted 5 hours. I was barely on it as I was busy and every time I checked the screen, my battery had dwindled another 15-20%. So when it got to 55%, I set it on my desk and walked away from it. Two hours later it was dead to world, in the middle of the afternoon.I'm coming from an iPhone (due to mine being water damaged). This seemed like a suitable replacement until I could afford to replace my iPhone. But after using an iPhone which lasts all day and doesn't get warm to the touch, this Palm Pre 2 was unacceptable.I liked the software, but the hardware has some serious issues. I wanted to give it two stars because I really liked the design of it, but two stars meant that I simply didn't like the phone. And I hated it.
+	Does everything I need a phone to do.  I read one review that didn't like the camera because it didn't have a flash.  This camera can do so many amazing things!!  Things I never knew cameras could do even!! In my opinion it doesn't need a flash!  Camera files are easy to save and upload to your computer. After I got it I read that it was the number 1 top selling prepaid phone on Amazon!  It's very pretty to look at and easy access to all your apps.
-	The phones voice box was muffled and it wouldnt even charge so i couldnt use it. I was very disappointed in it and i wont be buying from this seller ever again.
-	Wasn't impressed didnt have a lot.of the apps I used.  Just not for me personally. I do hosever, like the moving tiles, easy access.,
-	1. BECAUSE THE ITEM IS USED AND SOLD AS A NEW ME WHAT SHOULD I DO NOT GIVE ANY RATING ALSO NOT SWALLOW ME FOR NONE OF ACCESSORIESTwo. VEX ME NOT LIKE ME FIND IT IS SOLD AS NEW AND USEDThree. ANYONE
-	Phone new in box but will not connect to network appears defective.had to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
-	I had a galaxy proclaim for about a year.  I had no problems with it.  I spilled a drink on it and it stopped working.  I bought the centura as a replacement.  Here is what you can expect for a centura:Sometimes it takes as long as 30 seconds from the time you attempt a call for the phone to actually start making the call.  In that time you might mistakenly think that the phone is not responding, and you might attempt the call again.  Sooner or later it will make two calls to the same person.  The phone may be in your pocket by then.  To read an email it sometimes take 5 attempts to open it.  Messages are fine as long as they don't have an attachment.  If you try to view an attachment in a message you are likely to get the message "try downloading again later."  Whatever that means.  You can't send attachments in emails and messages unless they are pictures.  You can download non-picture items (such as documents), but you can't get them off of the phone.This phone is unreliable and a waste of money.
-	This phone was not a good buy for me. I purchased this phone in Sept. 2011. By June or July of 2012, the charging port stop working. I sent it in to the company for repairs. It was sent back to me in working conditions. About three months later, the original charger stopped working with the phone. I had to purchase another charger. On October 4, 2013 was the last time I was able to use this phone. As of today, I have a blank white screen. I can't make or receive calls. After taking the phone to a Boost Mobile Store, I was informed by the unconcern sales clerk, that I needed a new phone. The funny thing about this is my bill was down to $40.00, now whomever my next carrier is, my phone bill will not be this low. This just makes me wonder, is Boost Mobile making certain phones to last a certain amt. of time in order to have customers come back and purchase more expensive phones and plans?.......
+	This phone is cheap, slick, and smart. It has great camera effects you can play with BUT it is a windows phone. I give it four stars just because Windows is so behind in the app game.
-	This is not a good device. I do not recommend you purchase this items simply because it sucks.. only thing good is my service. No GPS... the pixel is not clear.. I was so upset when I took it out the box.. I knew it wasn't worth the money I spent. My messages is only one way to send..I wish I can get my money back for it... ...Warning don't buy.!!!!!!
-	the phone kept over heating and would not hold a charge for an hour even after being charged all night
+	I am so happy with my phone.  The calendar allows for unlimited entries. The picture quality is excellent.  Great choice.
+	I was looking for a new phone when my Kyocera event phone with virgin mobile stopped working. I went to WalMart and after shopping for different  phones I decided to try the Nokia Lumia 521 phone using Wal-Mart's family mobile plan. The salesman popped in the family mobile simcard, started the phone up and I  had voice calls right away. I didn't find out until I got home that the internet didn't work. I went to the library and use the internet there and found out that the Microsoft  account had to be setup before you could use the internet. I setup the Microsoft account and after that the phone's data was available to me. The internet works great on the Lumia 521 with faster download speeds then my old Kyocera event phone and much better battery life. With light to moderate use I could still have more then half a charge at the end of the day. The navigation apps are very useful and work consistently. The camera takes ok pictures, not great pictures and is good at scanning all kinds of barcodes. Overall, for this price point, this is one of the best phones out in the market.
+	Good product, met my expectation. I recommend it, Good price, Good quality. I like it, Thank you very much. !
+	I like it, but it does lack apps. the browser is decent, but there is no forward option. the keyboard does not react sometimes
-	This supposed to be an unlocked phone and that was the main reason I bought it. As soon as you insert the sim card you have this message: SIM Network unlock PIN. What do I have to do to have a real unlocked phone?? How you guys offer a factory unlock phone when that's not true?
-	Phone was perfect until 3 weeks in. Suddenly stop charging leaving me the inconvenience of not having a phone. Now I have to return with all my personal info still in phone because battery is dead and it won't charge.Stylus kept coming and the camera and pictures aren't as clear. Overall phone wasn't what I expected!!
+	Great window phone. Love it so far.  I think windows phone is a better phone  than android phone. I am liking it more and more every day.
-	This phone don't get good Reception with my phone Provider.no matter what i did it didnt help.i have Straight talk it did work but not good, so before u buy check how unlocked phone work with your Carrier..When i try to return it the seller ank me alot of questions that i didnt think it matter when i just wanted to send it back like who.my phone Provider
+	The Nokia Lumia 521 T-Mobile smart phone is great.  It is dragging me into the current century and doing so almost painlessly. I love it.
-	This phone worked for 1 whole day then shut down. That was some Bullsh**!! I was very disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!! THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THEY GAVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!
+	this phone is easy to use and that coming from a prior android phone user. the price at walmart for it was $130 unless they decide to change it. the non contract plans are great at tmobile and affordable.
-	I was very disappointed with the product as it can only be used  as a Sprint telephone. It is unlocked but not  compatible with AT&T;, T-Mobile. The add was misleading
+	I upgraded from a Nokia N95 and couldn't be happier. Feature-wise, the two phones are almost the same, but the performance of the X6 is vastly improved. Sure it's not hard to beat an old phone, but this one leaves me wanting for nothing.Like all top-end Nokia phones, it has great built-in features: GPS, camera/video, music player, FM radio, wifi, 3g.Apps load very fast, and the native browser loads really quick too. Wifi reception is great, and the GPS locks on within seconds.The glass touchscreen is very accurate and easy to use; the display is beautiful. The haptic feedback is a little inconsistent or delayed, but it doesn't distract.Menu layout is improved too, and once you figure it out, everything is within a tap or two. The Contacts layout on the home screen is hugely useful.My one complaint is headphone volume is too loud or soft; the controls are not fine enough. That was true on the N95 too.
+	It got here fast and I think this is a great value for the money.  The only issue I have as I learn more about what the phone can and cannot do, is that the manual that comes with it is very brief.  One has to go online or call T-Mobile to get assistance in figuring things out.  I must say that the techs at T-Mobile are hit or miss with their knowledge base, and they need to get more educated about the phone.  A T-Mobile rep wanted me to re-install the system when all I needed was an adjustment, one that is normally within the phone settings.  I suggest using Nokia's website rather than using T-Mobile for information.
+	it is very fluid and it has a great screen! the touchcreen is super sensitive and very responsive another great thing it windows phone 8 and a 100$ phone! nokia has outdone itself again the phone also feels great in the hand
+	Well I purchased the 521 to use on a Tmobile MVNO prepaid carrier and it works great! It even supports HD Voice calls because my mother is using it and when she calls (I have a Nexus 5) the call has SKYPE quality sound! Don't expect all iPhone or Android apps available but if you need Facebook, Twitter, email, Youtube (metrotube app), tunein radio, etc., those are available. For HD voice both users need to be in a HSPA+ coverage area I believe. I'm very happy with the Lumia 521 smartphone purchase.
-	The phone keeps hanging. if I open any app and just lock the phone for 2 hours or more, the phone would get hanged.If i'm on call for more than half an hour, the phone gets hanged. I have to remove the battery and then turn it on.I would not recommend it to anyone.
-	the worse phone ever.! nothing worked  really sorry pic quality none of the apps work! 100 % boot leg lol!
+	I am trying out the windows phone platform formerly using an android (which I Liked).  This basic model has some very nice features.  The hardest part for me was transferring my music files so I can use for ringtones and texts.  The phone is slim and light, graphics are colorful and bright and live tiles are very cool (and useful).  The battery is super long lasting even with apps running.I received the phone very fast (under 7 days).I am really enjoying learning about this phone.  I will order from this seller again.
+	This phone is great!!! It is very low priced, and has a lot of great features. I love the camera most I think, and the style of it. It came before estimated delivery date and nothing was wrong with it! Thanks so much!!
-	queria saber que ha pasado con mi compra de este telefono que todavia no me ha llegado. no puedo deir mas
-	I purchased the Nokia 521 in July and two and a half months later the battery on the phone completely broke. Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible. I would have to charge it multiple times a day.
+	I was nervous buying a Window 8 phone.  I have never had a smart phone, so i was not confused by Windows 8 as many said i would be.  I think it is a great quality phone.  (Lumia 521)  I love the movable tiles and after playing with it and reading the booklet, I feel like i have a good understanding of my phone without a lot of difficulty.  I got a great easy to use phone for a fraction of the price of other smart phones.  It is a bit hard to find covers and cases, especially the gel kind, that fit these phones.  But that is not a huge problem in my estimation.  So happy I go this phone.
-	Overall a good phone for the price.The one issue I have is with the "dailer" app. Keeps on hanging up during calls. I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue. Putting the phone on speaker reduces the frequency of this bug, but I cannot be on speaker constantly just because this device/software glitches. This negates all the positives of this device and I will be replacing it.
-	I am not satisfied with the purchase because the cell phone camera does not work please tell me how i can solve the problem
+	I  was looking around for a no-contract smart phone. I considered a no-contract Samsung Galaxy, no-contract iPhone, etc. All of them were in the $400-600 price range. The Lumia 521 was $115. It seemed to have all the features I wanted, so I gave it a try.  Wow. This is a good phone. Call quality is fine. The battery life is better than my old Samsung Galaxy Nexus. The Windows Phone interface has proved easy to use. It has been easy to connect to gmail, outlook, calendars. Less games available than for Android or iOS, but for 1/5 the price, I'm really not complaining.
-	Did not work for my service like they said it would,slow not fast at all just horrible!!plus it takes forever to get it and no tracking
-	Total crap wasn't worth to even order its slow won't load app it foreclosed everything not worth the time to get
+	My galaxy s4 broke and this Nokia Lumia 521 was the perfect replacement. Pretty advanced features for a super affordable phone. Fell in love with the customizable background apps. Misplaced it once, went to windows.com and they made the phone the ring super loud for me. Neat feature. Gave me location and everything. Love this cute little phone.
+	This is probably the best budget smartphone I have used. Granted, I upgraded to the more powerful Lumia 925 but if you are someone looking for a smartphone at a great price, look no further!This phone is fast, sleek, and efficient. The Windows Phone experience isn't bogged down or laggy (i.e. budget Androids) and it simply works!I'm a converted WP8 fan and look forward to more!
-	This product its not new its refurbished. The ond - off bottom slips off, the back case doesnt fit. The USB cable doesnt match the model. The manual its generic and with a CD the seller made up...I am very sad that Amazon its allowing this seller to do this to customers. ITS A RIP OFF
-	I purchased this phone for use in South Africa. It keeps losing connection to the wireless network (MTN) and I have had to restart it numerous times. If I remove the main SIM card on Sim 1 slot leaving the roaming SIM card on Sim 2 slot, then the phone works ok. But I didnt buy the phone for single SIM use. One Friday evening, I restarted the phone which stayed on for about 3 hours but then on Saturday morning, the phone lost connectivity to the wireless network. I contacted the seller who provided initial layman correspondence, eventually suggesting that I return the phone to a manufacturer in Germany, which I preferred not to, but then the correspondence died along the way. Very very disappointed with the purchase, and especially that I had purchased to units..
-	This is the worst phone ever. It's made of all plastic, the screen darkens randomly and flickers ! Also you have to push the button down hard just to select something . NOTHING like an iPhone ! So the description is a lie. It doesn't have an App Store and Ive been trying to contact the seller but they haven't answered my emails so I guess they don't want to refund me ! The phone sucks . Amazon should not allow this for sale . I wish I could rate it 0 stars !
+	I'm using Nokia for many years and have model LUMIA 521 yen a year, it works without problems now bought another for a gift for a friend. It is a pity that there is no flash lamp s but for the price it is difficult to'd expect all the accessories.
+	First of all this vendor sent this way fast. It was at my door step practically within 30 hours. Thank you! It came packaged in original Tmobile style. All the accessories included. The phone itself is fast in replying to text. The voice command I think is faster than my Note 2. Boo I know but I finally have a back up that is small to fit in my pocket. Love this product. No flash but my back up was meant for other things vs. pics. Thank you again. I would buy from this vendor again should this one come up missing.
-	This phone I purchased takes a whole day to charge. Once the phone needs charging, you have to leave it on charge for a whole day to charge. So its basically like you can only use the phone every other day. Even if you let it charge for eight hours, the battery level doesn't even go to half full. This may be a defective phone because I have bought two others for other family members through a different seller and those other two do not have any problems. I contacted the seller and they told me to contact the company that makes the phone. They didn't even offer a replacement phone. Guess since they already got my money they can care less if the phone works properly or not. I wont be ordering from this company again.
-	this phone is not what i expected.i can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
+	You cannot beat the price of this phone. I like it more than my Samsung Galaxy. The screen resolution isn't great and there is no flash on the camera, but I can live with that for this price. I was surprised that I love the Windows Phone interface, it is easy to use, easy to customize and looks cool. For this price, there is no reason not to buy this phone.
-	Device only worked correctly  for 60 days and they would not give me an replacement. Money down the drain, don't buy!
-	Do not buy this phone. It is a waste of money. I turned it off and it will not turn on it gets stuck at the t-mobile screen. When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened. I also had to switch my sim car d to a smaller one and most phones that are this inexpensive still use the regular SIM cards except not this one so now i am dealing with t mobile to get me a new SIM card and they are giving me so much of a Hassan because all my old previous phones use a different sim.
-	Front camera was low quality, the actual cellphone its self was very, very, slow, I couldn't even access the internet with my data plan without having to use wifi, but thats why I PAY for unlimited internet. Save up and get something better. Its a terrorist phone -_-
+	Let me cut to the chase here. You can't get a better new smartphone at this price without contract. It works well, the OS is fluid, the phone looks good and is cheap, period. You can't go wrong with this price. Highly recommended.
+	Was not much of a learning curve from iphone 4 for my husband.  He LOVES this phone as compared to the iphone because it has so many more features such as voice dialing and texting.  We put an app named "Assistant" on it and it reads his email and texts for him too.  He drives a mobile transport unit and it makes it possible for him to perform his job and get the instructions for the next pick up from dispactch!  You couldn't do better for the price.  And it does extra large text so that he doesn't even need his readers!
+	I purchased this when it was on Amazon's Lightning Deal for $55. I purchased it for my father who isn't really technology savy and this was his first smart phone. He loves it. The Nokia's window 8 Design makes it simple to use. The free GPS without using data is also a plus. There is also a free $20 Windows App voucher if you have bought this phone before January 31st, 2014. you just have to find the page for the voucher and register your Nokia Lumia 521 on Nokia's site. What a deal! The only con for me is that it does not have a flashlight. Well what can I say? For the price point this was a fantastic deal even though it did not have a flashlight.
+	I ‘m very picky usually when I buy something like this, but I was forced to take a fast decision this time (by a broken old phone) and I have no regrets! And I bought it for $140 not 70, 6+ months ago from Walmart. So for this price don’t even think, has a lot of apps and features you can use, GPS and no data plan necessary, is really a good deal! I’ll buy again if I’ll need one! Only problems I had were dropped calls few times, but I’m pretty sure it was carrier’s fault. A very good battery life, but I’m not a heavy user. God job, Nokia!
-	The phone is not ideal for anyone who likes the download games, music, text or email on their phones. But if ou just make and receive calls only, then the phone is perfect for you.
-	good estimates like to greet all my purchases this has caused me some headache when you buy the lumia nokia unlocked thought this when I get the request to Venezuela first phone battery did not work, I had to buy another in Venezuela after I buy achievement battery and turn on the phone I do not get this one released buy digitel simcard and phone calls without the code and I do not take any, if they could help me with this problem I would appreciate
-	The GPS hardware port is lock! new arrived with  "acquire a GPS signal" forever, after email support get new version of Ostia problem solve, once hard reset problem happen again, update the ROM from pharo, the problem/bug happen on 2007 still there[...]when this problem happen even use the other software like tomtom, garmin, googlemap... not any software can get the gps signal, looks like software can detect the GPS but "acquire a GPS signal" forever.plus the Ostia GPS software can not find the right RD route. if the hardware and software both have big BUG, it is a junk, do not buy PHAROS gps.
+	The phone works really good. For the price, the phone is perfect. I have no complains. I went through 4 androids before buying this phone, and none compare to what this phone can do. Good reception. Yes no flash or front camera, but again your only paying $70 for a phone. To be honest I was more surprised by the performance than worried about that. Good phone for affordable price.
-	i dont like the protuct it looks too cheap i thought that it is better than my old one it looks worse THANK YOU
+	Awesome, I was a Samsung (original Samsung Galazy S) user, this phone was a major step up in all respects except for the camera.  I am getting used to the camera but miss that feature.Pros:Ease of useAttaching photos in emails is very fluid including the ability to select several at one time without toggling back and forthLightNice DisplayBasic Functions are all Consistant (I REALLY appreciate this)  I would say the calls and texts are better on this phone, thanks NOKIA you have always dont this part well.Streams well. :)Great price!Cons:CameraLimited apps (but I really don't mind)
-	I bought this phone last year for my daughter who is currently living in Jamaica. The phone is no good as far as I am concerned and I should have tested it before taking it to her in Jamaica when I went on my vacation. From the very first moment the phone battery did not last an hour after the first initial charging process. Then it stated to freeze. It would not accept the Digicel sim card that they use in Jamaica and we had to take it to the Digicel office to have them fix that. I remained hopeful and my daughter did not want to part with the phone although it will never remained charged for more than a couple minutes even after been placed on charge for hours. I left it down there with promises to get her a replacement when I returned to the USA. The phone started to overheat so badly on her that her mother refused to let her use it anymore in fear that it may hurt her. It was sent back to me recently and now I am stuck with it and have lost my money. No one wants to purchase it even for parts and now I am hoping to sell it on EBay. I am very disappointed in this product and would never recommend anyone to these phones or attempt to purchase another of this kind. This is my second most disappointed product experience with purchasing a product on amazon. This is very unfortunate to know that I lost my money in such a hard economy that we are presently living in. I didn't even want to give this product the one star rating to show how disappointed I am with this product. I hope that they (Amazon) takes this off their website as it only makes Amazon look bad although not liable for the quality of this product, it still reflects on the company and the products and services offered.
+	I need the phone only occasionally.we have laptops and galaxy tablet in home. So I was looking for a smartphone that I would only on road, that too occasionally for browsing. The phone has all the needy features. And the brandname Nokia  , on which we rely a lot.so far, no problem with the phone.One thing to mention, if you use the phone on a pay by day plan like myself, change the settings to airplane mode on the days you are not using. Otherwise,  I found my balance on phone getting reduced.
+	He LOVES this phone!  He mentioned to me that the battery is lasts for a very long time.  A great deal!
+	I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for my Sony Z1s (I had to send it back to Sony for warranty reasons) and it really has exceeded my expectations for $70.  If you aren't attached to Google or Apple apps then I highly recommend this phone.  It has most of the apps you will need, is dirt cheap and works really well.Pros:1.  The OS is very fluid and easy to use.2.  The screen is not bad and actually streams Hulu and Netflix better since the resolution is more standard (Hulu and Netflix upscale horribly on a very high resolution screens like my Sony Z1s).3.  The camera is adequate in decent light.4.  Battery life is decent.  I can get through the day 5am - 6pm and still have some battery left.  During the day I usually use 1 hr of streaming video and 1 hr of audio plus checking email and Facebook throughout the day.5.  Voice recognition is great when available.6.  Good selection of established messaging apps for you to keep in touch with your friends.Cons:1.  The app store is pretty dismal.2.  If your friends use Google Hangouts, you're going to be left out.3.  There's no front facing camera for you "selfie" loving people or people who video conference with their phones.4.  No camera flash.  (not sure if that's really a con for me though.  just thought i'd throw that out though)5.  No LTE.  (but seems quick enough for everyday use)Originally I thought I'd sell this phone once I got my Sony back but now I'm thinking about keeping it to play with and as a backup should my Sony fail again.  I'm really excited to see what 8.1 w/ Cortana brings.
-	I was terribly disappointed with this phone.  I spent months writing back and forth to blue and my phone service provider trying to resolve problem with texting pictures.  Finally went to the Geek Squad and learned I only have 300 K to send pictures .  Very disappointed with the functioning of the phone.  I would not recommend this phone and I would not purchase it again.
-	This is not Galaxy SIII but Galaxy SIII "GT" model with reduced capabilities  It has lower processor, memory and other capabilities.  To add to the insult there is no 4G LTE.It is SHOCKING that they have not described that this is not a really SAMSUNG Galaxy SIII.  I bought and returned the phone.  This kind of false advertising puts the credibility of the merchant and Amazon.com in question.
+	I am new to the whole smartphone market, but I must say that I love this phone. It has a large screen, the phone is constructed durably, and the whole Windows 8 system looks sleek in addition to being easy to use. You can reorganize the "live tiles" however you want. Regarding sound, the speaker is excellent when placed on a hardtop surface; I often listen to music on this device. Typing text messages is a breeze. Calling someone, real easy.Not a bad deal at all. Make sure to get a transparent protector for the screen (Illumishield is awesome) and get a hard protector case. Enjoy!
+	Good phone, long pin as Nokia products. I read many comments said that bad phone. I don't think so. Try!
-	The camera stopped working after one week.  Sometimes it's back but mostly it just wont take pictures.  And if it does you ca't view them because the phone is so slow it hangs while trying to execute its own picture browser/viewer.  Half the time it saves pics and vids in a corrupt way that you cant view them on the phone.  Sometimes something as simple as replying an sms is impossible because "maximum number of applications" are running which is bull cause absolutely nothing else is running.  It's by far the slowest phone I've ever used.  My old sonyericcson t68i is faster in all respects than this piece of garbage.  There's more bugs than code in its software.  The only positive thing i can say is that it's tough to break.  I know 'cause i've slammed it into walls a couple of times out of frustration.  After gathering the pieces and putting them back together, it still makes phone calls, and everything else still sucks.  The reason for the wall slamming is that I got tired of opening it and removing the battery to unfreeze it.  The only reason I got this phone was the dual sim.  Well, the second sim slot doesn't work either even though it's supposed to be an unlocked universal gsm phone.  I'd give this several stars below zero if we had negative scores on amazon.  Seriously those chinese rip-offs that resemble iphones and blackberries but have tv, 4 sims, and whatnot, work better than this seemingly legit LG product.
+	Nokia phones are famous for being tough as nails and this phone is no exception! I work on a farm, so I didn't want anything too expensive and I needed something that would hold up. I dropped my Nokia Lumia 521 in a bucket of water and it still works perfectly. (I was at work, so it didn't make into a bag of rice for three more hours! And it was still fine!)I listen to music for four hours every morning while I clean the barn and use it for basic texting, facebook and calling for the rest of the day. The battery lasts about two days with this use. I usually charge it every night, but if I don't, it still lasts until the next evening.I wouldn't suggest this phone if you love taking high quality pictures. There is no zoom but it works well enough.I would suggest getting a case for it, as the phone is so sleek you always feel like you're going to drop it. I have a TECH21 case and it's perfect.
-	very basic phone. does not work with car bluetooth (works with Mazda but not with BMW)cheap plastic and quite inconvenient features.  will not recommend.
-	I was unable to change the time and date after following the directions. When I changed the date it reverts to the default date. As for time, I try to change it to New York time as I live in the same zone, the time does not change. I am disappointed. I cannot use it as an alarm too.
-	I had to exchange 2-3 phone from amazon for this phone, could not accept SIM card, I went to tmobile they tried all they could not get it working, amazon replaced it wit new same problem. So it's better to just go to tmobile and get it from them. U might pay little more but u get insurance. So never buying phone this one or other from amazon. But they were nice enough to return money fast. So don't get it
+	I really like my phone! It is in all ways, exceeding my past expectations. It is beautiful, big, and flawless. It comes with everything you need, and what's more, the cases and screen protectors are inexpensive. Yay or nay? I say Yay!
+	This is my first smart phone.  I never wanted to get one because of the ridiculous cost, so I used my flip phone for years.  This phone has performed well, and does everything I need it to, and more.  Highly recommended, especially if you don't want to spend several hundred dollars on a phone.
-	The phone has a very poor sound quality.  I always have to use a headset to enable me hear what the other party is saying
-	I'm not hating on Droid RAZRs. They are actually pretty cool phones. But I would advise against getting second hand phones, especially ones that are as nice as this one. The previous owner must have sent it back for some reason. Now I am hesitant yet tempted to do so. But I do not want another buyer to go through the same horrors as me.The bottom line is that this phone has a terribly weak connection with its charger. And If I plug it in, it will maybe charge 10% of the time, whether it is off or on. Now you can imagine there is no more detrimental flaw than to have your phone refuse to charge or turn on for the better part of its usage. It cost me so much that I was actually foolish enough to depend on it to get me to my new awesome kayak tour job in San Diego. And the damn thing died during the night after I plugged it in at a 20% charge. I was not able to make it to the job on time in the most crucial of busy days and now I no longer have that awesome job.So in a nutshell, this phone has ruined my life and it can possibly ruin yours. My next step is to learn from it and stick it to Amazon somehow if I have a warranty or not because this is unacceptable. Not recommended if you wish to keep your job or stay in contact with anyone.sincerely,Loyal Amazon Customer
+	It will be a great phone once i get it right with straight talk. I purchased this phone for my son and I would recommend this phone
+	Pro: Cost ($69.00 on Microsoft store website + FREE SHIPPING), Speed, Great Camera, User Friendly, Elegant Design, Multifunction: Wifi calling,etcCon: None. Don't be Android or Apple product close mindedBought this phone on the Microsoft store website at such a great deal $69.00 - includes SIM card. If you're new to the "smart phone" technology this is a great beginner phone. If you already own an Android or Apple product then your reviews will be biased because of what you already know and love. I'm not hating.. just telling the truth.Without any prior smart phone experience after 2 days watching youtube Nokia 521 videos & practice, you'll be a pro! The phone has great processing speed so navigating through the apps is flawless without any lag. There's 8GB internal memory as well as microSD slot expanded memory. I've used this phone for 1 week and I have no regrets. People, you need to understand cell phone companies are no longer offering contracts & free phones. Why buy or finance an expensive Samsung or Iphone if you really don't use its full potential? Buy it. Enuff said
+	Nokia always makes excellent, very durable mobile phones. I'm happy with it. It's prepaid too. Need I say more? :)
+	i love this phone. works great have had no problems with it.sound quality is better than old one.all in all good phone.
+	This is one of the best celll phones that I  have purchased.  It exceeds my expectations.  Battery life is great. Easy to  use and get to know.  Nice phone for an senor.
-	This phone is awful! For starters, activation alone is enough to almost make you want to return the phone. I never had to google how to activate a phone until I got this one. This was the most difficult non-smart phone I have ever encountered.To top it off, the app store would not work once I finally got the bloody thing activated! I had to google how to fix that too. You shouldn't have to go through all of this for a "simple" phone that runs Web OS. The poor app selection is fine with me since I mainly needed a phone with a physical qwerty keyboard for texting. I can also sync my email to it, so that is a plus. It is safe to say that if I dropped this phone or it breaks, I will NOT buy another one of these!
+	This is a nice Windows Phone for a great price. Switched my T-Mobile 3-line family plan to their new plan and pay 60% less per month even after an adding a 4th line. This phone to replace an HTC HD7 which had lots of flaky hardware issues.Windows 8 is a good improvement from WP7. Clear smooth and responsive. Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia. Windows phone apps aggregate content well and app selection is growing.WiFi calling is nice to have. Good battery life, screen, speaker and camera are nice.Having to setup 3 accounts (T-Mobile, Microsoft and Nokia) is a little bit of a nuisance, but overall setup is easy.The phone I received had a broken volume-up switch, but Amazon return was simple. If not for this, would have rated 5 stars.
-	The 4g memory is way too small. I've only had the phone a week & haven't downloaded half of the apps I had on my last phone yet I'm getting the message "storage space running low!" When I look in the settings it appears there's still space in the phone storage & on the SD card, so I'm confused. I've emailed Blu & they're responding thankfully. I'm not sure they'll help as they claim it is the phones internal memory that's running low, to move some apps over to the SD card, but some apps can not go over to the SD card. I'm afraid to root the phone & void warrenty bc then I'll get no help at all. I'll probably end up returning it. Really disappointed.
-	I bought this expecting what it was. A $150 phone. But the total lack of netflix? Come on. The $50 prepaid phone plays netflix fine. According to blu they are " working on it" but have no eta. Basically a "just buy a different phone" answer.Viewing angles are poor as well. looking at it like you would any other phone means the bottom half of the screen is blacked out. Tilt the top away from you and it's better.The screen size is big, but it's a polished turd at best.Waiting for the nexus 5, then this will go one of my kids, if they can handle the lack of netflix.
-	I just received this phone, but so disappointed. The phone is either in Portuguese or Spanish. The user manual doesn't say anything on how to solve this. I called Samsung customer care and they said they could not help, ad asked me to return it. So annoying, yet I wanted a phone asap
+	This is my second smartphone- I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy Exhibit II which was an Android device.  After having so many issues with my Exhibit, I didn't want to purchase another Samsung which left me with few options that were far more expensive.  By chance, I saw the announcement for the release of the Nokia 521 and decided to give it a try.  The price tag of $150 was the main reason I chose the phone.I'm a basic phone user.  Not really into all the tech specs, games or social media.  But I'll mention that later.  Overall, the phone was very easy to set up.  Installed my Outlook, Gmail and Yahoo email accounts without an issue.  Wi-Fi setup was a breeze.  The touchscreen is fast and very responsive.  Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.  No problems with the screen brightness as it is adjustable.  The buttons are strangely placed- the power button is directly below the volume controls and can be a little tricky to press depending on the case.  That's another thing- the cases for this phone are few and not all work with the model.Windows Phones are a bit different since the Live Tiles is a feature not included with my Android.  It's basically geared toward an active social lifestyle.  Tiles are customizable and it works with Facebook to constantly update your notifications, photos and status updates.  You can easily set up shared groups and a family room to communicate with family members (sharing notes, photos, calenders, etc).Apps: This is my biggest issue. Windows apps are different from those the Android market.  I expected there to be less to choose from (which is fine, I don't need thousands of gadgets) but I didn't quite expect all the apps to work so differently. I have the normal applications installed- Facebook, Pinterest,Tumblr, Amazon, Evernote, etc. Certain things are  difficult, for example, the Pinterest app is a major headache since the interface is laid out nothing like Android.  Facebook doesn't let you unlike pages or delete friends easily.Comes loaded with Nokia apps.  You can use the Maps offline, listen to music for free, etc.The camera is basic.Overall, it's a great phone.  I recommend it for anyone who wants a basic smartphone for a great price.  Feel free to ask any questions.  :)
+	This is a great phone. The price makes it OUTSTANDING! I would recommend this phone to anyone on the TMobile system.
-	This phone...  oh god, this phone.  I bought TWO even though I read the awful reviews.THIS PHONE.  It randomly shuts off.  My keypad is literally falling off seven months after I bought it.  I charge it ALL DAY, make ONE CALL, and IT DIES.Do. Not. Buy. This. Phone.
-	Had a friend get one of these for me, because he heard that I needed a second burner phone for a time period when I was working on a project for work. I got the phone, charged it, started playing with it, and then almost immediately had to return it and get an Android phone. While Windows Phone has a lot of the major apps it has none of the specialty or local apps that I need. It also has no Google Drive support, which I absolutely have to have for work. What's worse, Bing was absolutely useless in the country I was in.If you just want an upgrade from a dumb phone and don't need to have access to any of the great apps on iOS or Android, go ahead and waste your money on this phone. If you want to actually have a phone you can use and that has access to literally everything that is available, spend a fractional amount more and get an Android.
+	I never expected to love this phone. I just wanted a GPS device and an MP3 player. I got both and more. Now I'm hoping for more app support cause I don't want to switch from the windows phone OS.
+	Until my prior android phone was stolen (Samsung Galaxy S) I had honestly never considered a Windows phone (I really dislike Windows 8 on my PC), but after a week with this phone i am extremely impressed. I bought it primarily because of it's low cost and some positive reviews (I watched a few hands-on videos). The OS is very, very fast compared to my last phone, and the interface is exceedingly slick. If you know you're only going to use your phone for a few things (for me it's calls, texting, web, and twitter) than this is great purchase. The camera doesn't seem terrific, but it's not a deal-breaker for me. If you're looking for a budget smart phone this is a great pick.
-	the phone by it self should be a good phone easy to use and good features but you shouldn't buy it from this seller.!!! He sent me a old phone in an repacked box (not the palm pixi box) I tryed alling the costomer service thay didn't answar and didn't call back... After 10 times calling day after the other thay picked up the phone and thay told Me. Sorry can't help u  ... It's not the first time buying by them and the first time I sent back the item rite away bec. It wasn't the rite item I order... So if you wanna buy the palm pixi buy it it's a good phone but not from this seller.
+	My perspective:I've owned iphone and android previously. Realized that I have wifi at home, at work, and at the shops I frequent. In an attempt to save money, I canceled my current data plan and trying to go with the best alternate. I've also used Skype for years, and have relatives overseas.521 Pros:- Fantastic Skype integration. Will use speaker by default, but you can change that and use it like a phone. Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality. Only drawback is no front facing camera. Also, you'll miss Skype calls when the phone is asleep, but FIXED if the phone is plugged in charging.- OFFLINE Maps. Turn-by-turn voice directions. NO DATA PLAN REQUIRED, since maps download to your phone. However, you must know the address of where you're heading, since searching for 'Jiffylube' will not return results without a dataplan or wifi hotspot.- Loud Speaker. Listened to a ball game recently with it...set it on the counter and I could hear it clearly from 30 ft. Puts more expensive phones to shame.- Slick Interface. WP8 is smooth as butter, even with the hardware being somewhat below current expectations. Touch screen is same as iphone, very quick and responsive.- SD Card. Tried a 32GB card, which worked. Also falls into the CONS category, though.521 Cons:- Slippery. Cover fixes that. I thought covers would snap-on, but they're the typical wrap-around types.- SD Card. WP8 limits use to media files and photos only. You can upload other file types from USB, but you won't be able to find the files. Also, the USB uses the MTP protocal. For example, running EXE files from the SD storage on windows will fail (MTP limits random access to files). Guess you'll still need that trusty USB stick or HD, no thanks to Microsoft's great decision to use ancient MTP.- WP8 (windows phone 8 OS). I like many things about the OS, but they made some poor decisions. The security acts like an iphone, where each app is sandboxed. This makes things difficult: sharing files, making email attachments, or downloading general files. Accordingly, no file browser exists. Also, no alternative browsers exist (NO chrome, NO firefox, NO dolphin, etc), nor any alternative keyboards.- Camera. Great quality in good light, but lack of flash limits its use.Conclusion:Overall, I'm happy with the phone and like 80% of WP8. Happy enough that I bought another for the wife. However, WP8 needs to LISTEN to their customers and make some compromises while the OS is still young and alive. If not, my next phone will likely be an android, and I imagine WP8 will die a few years later.
-	I've had this phone for about a year.  It now randomly shuts off and reboots.  It also sometimes has a hard time finding a signal in places I absolutely know a good signal exists.  I had a Motorola Razor for 6 years with no problems.  Our phones should not start breaking after a year, it's unacceptable.  As a result, I will never by a Samsung phone ever again.
+	Love this phone i use it all the time. the 4g speeds are faster than i expected for such a cheap phone .
+	For the price this is an amazing phone. It turns out I'm not too keen on having a Windows phone (did have an iPhone).As far as the phone itself goes, the backside is made of plastic, which I didn't realize but after putting on a sturdy cover that's no problem. The screen is pretty great with good quality. I'm also quite happy with the sound quality both on calls and music. The antenna seems to work really well and I often have a very good signal though I live out in the country. A negative, though is that I cannot seem to keep the Wifi connected. I'm constantly having to reboot the phone to keep it from using cellular data which is a ridiculous expense when I'm sitting 4 feet away from my router.The apps on the phone leave something to be desired. There's no Candy Crush, Instagram is new and I haven't been able to get it work properly plus there aren't apps that I've learned to take for granted. My bank doesn't have an app for Windows Phone so where I had been able to deposit checks through my phone I don't have that option. I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone. If apps aren't a big deal to you then this phone really is great. I think I should have done a bit more research before taking the plunge on apps, so I'd really recommend that  you see if you can have access to the ones you'll need or see if you can find an acceptable alternative.
-	the phone does not work power button is stuck so it wont turn on at all and i got the sim card for it and it wont register to the phone so i would like to return this phone and just get my money back....please and thank youjessica
-	After 8 months of owning the device, it has destroyed two 64GB memory cards. Both cards failed after a few weeks of usage, were basically loaded with media file to play. Whatever, I stopped using the phone for media. Now, on my eight month of usage, the phone has decided that it can not be charged beyond 15-17% while the phone is on. If I turn the phone off, I can charge it, otherwise it is useless. The low paid morons at the Verizon store were of no help, they would not offer to replace or repair the phone. While I didn't buy the piece of junk on Amazon, I feel compelled to warn as many people as I can about this terrible device. I'm not even going to mention all the various bugs and problems with the Android operating system. YUCK!
-	Very disappointed in this purchase. The phone looked good when it came but only worked for a day! I couldn't find my receipt ao I feel like we got "stuck"! Very disappointed! Do not recommend buying from this buyer! Was mislead!
-	second day I had this phone started to shut on and off. Did some research and apparently this model "521" has a issue with the battery fitting too loosely. Yeah you could rig it by stuffing a piece of tape or something but the point is its a new phone, you shouldn't have to! The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen. You can adjust the sensitvity but it doesnt seem to change that much. Camera is good in light only, and the apps are pretty cool for the camera. Overall, spend a little more for a better phone.
-	This phone is nothing but treble. I bought this phone to use my country (Bangladesh). Call quality is very bad. Forget about using internet. After using for a week phone died on me.
+	Love my phone works great would recommend it to friends and family!! I also recieved it on time!!!! Learn something new on it everyday.
-	I recently bought a Blu Studio 5.0 unlocked US warranty From the day I received it, the audio was giving trouble. It reached a point just today that whenever I receive a call the hearing sensitivity was extremely low then the ring tone went completely. The speaker to the back of the phone has extreme distortion. I would not recommend this phone, not even for free. I will be returning this phone to amazon, and I would hope that they comply with their warranty. I am extremely unsatisfied and disappointed with this product. I am requesting an immediate refund, and for me not another BLU brand.
-	Do not buy this phone.  It will freeze on you and not work.So many bugs with Windows 7.Repeat. Do not buy.
-	Has small storage space. The sound is terrible, I cannot hear what the other person is saying nor can they hear what I'm saying! You just hear a caller talking at a distance and you have to keep repeating them. But the screen is great!
+	perfect cell for me, easy to handle, not too much tech.just perfect for someone not so cell phone savvylove it
-	I don't know why Nokia dropped the Meemo/Meego/Hartman/Symbian operating systems, which were the BEST, simple and most effective. The Windows Mobile 8 operating system makes the Nokia phone just not "SMART" enough for a smartphone. Just like the Windows 8 that I choose to ditch in the favor of Windows Pro 7, the windows mobile 8 is probably by far the worst compared to iOS, Android and other proprietary OS's.Don't get me wrong: the phone is good, light weight, looks solid, decent appearance, good battery life indeed. Highly excited about the new phone, as I stick my sim card in, I can't see my contacts. You require a MICROSOFT account to ACCESS all your CONTACTS, leaving your privacy completely exposed. If you do create a Microsoft account, all of the sudden, ALL YOUR CONTACTS are uploaded on the Microsoft server, along with your history. Why can't I just use the phone WITHOUT giving Microsoft my list of contacts? Why does Microsoft need to know and access that? I tried deleting the contacts, and guess what? Just like the GMAIL account ( that I dropped years ago for privacy reasons) Microsoft will still "keep" all your contacts "just in case you change your mind"! And it tracks ALL your history of browsing, calling, texting, searching and installed apps! I feel like the Big Brother watching over my shoulder! I call that INVASION OF PRIVACY! I can't sync my private email account, unless it's an "APPROVED VENDOR" on the list, that likes to create and keep a history of everything you do on the account. I can't fully use the bluetooth features like with other phones (Iphone and Android). I can't just close an application when I have multiple apps opened, instead you have to select it and keep clicking on back until it takes you to the main Home Screen.Update:Major Cons:1) I found most of the apps to be useless/"entry level". Can't compare the quality of the apps to the iOS and Android. ( I had both) If you are a heavy user of email / productivity apps you'll hardly find anything on the "Microsoft Market". You'll be able to open Microsoft Office docs but you'll need an app for PDF's, that will be "entry level". Android opens PDF's "natively" and even has a "night mode" to invert colors! What a downgrade!2) You cannot sync all your accounts in one along with receiving updates as they come in. The phone will only sync the mail box/ other apps "every 15, 30 minutes / 1 or 2 hrs".2) Camera only works in good day light with a "decent" resolution and quality and there's no flash. Don't expect anything else from the camera.3) The phone side buttons and touch "buttons" are not clearly marked / lit. If you're in the dark it will take a while to figure out where to press.4) Screen although responsive when sliding, it lags and does not fully react to smaller option menus or when trying to accurately copy/paste. Cheap phone, cheap response.5) Closing an app will take longer than with any other OS. Basically you click and hold back, wait for the opened app screen, selected the app and just press escape(back until closed. (this could be as long as 9 to 12 times if you've clicked several options in the app, tracking your steps backwards) Really?6) Auto rotation of the screen cannot be removed/stopped. This can get annoying if you're not sitting/standing in vertical position.7) Bluetooth will only work for certain devices / services.Major Pros1) Nokia off-line GPS and maps are the ONLY good thing, (that's not Microsoft's credit) worth with this phone.2) Relatively cheap phone.Inconclusivea)Battery is good, not great. You can charge it every day or 1-1/2 days but no more than that.b) The so-called wifi calling only gives you the option of making calls over your wifi but does not increase the quality of the call. Unless you are within the clear range (same room with the router, no walls) of the wifi transmitter, EXPECT the call to DROP!c) You don't get any cool pre-installed ring tones, but at least the speaker and the audio volume will be loud. This should be expected from a phone.Overall in my experience Windows Mobile just sucks (Not just version 8)! This is a major flaw that cannot be corrected no matter what windows phone you'll get. I'm sorry but I'll have to take this back and stick to another operating system.
+	In these days of having to outright buy a phone that costs several hundred dollars, or pay that same amount or more over time in a cellular contract, this phone is a true breath of fresh air!  I admit I was extremely skeptical because of the price, but I have been very pleasantly surprised with its performance.  Phone calls are very clear, the speakerphone is terrific, texting, email and Facebooking are a snap.  I never even have to take my phone out of my pocket in the car: it reads me my texts and transcribes my replies through the Bluetooth!  I couldn't do that with my Android.Being able to actually open a Microsoft Word or Excel document may be of significant value to some as well.  This is a great feature!  I use the Notes feature a lot, and it is very easy to organize...you can even make check boxes, numbering or bullet points quite simply.  The battery lasts longer than I would have expected also (two days for me), and you can also buy replacement batteries.  The camera is pretty fantastic, even though it does not have a flash.While the Windows app store is certainly limited compared to Apple's or even those available for Android, it is growing.  If you're an app addict, this may not be the phone for you - just yet.  However, if your main list of priorities is a phone that works well for smartphone functions, save yourself a bunch of money and buy this one (I just bought another for my husband)!
-	I bought a Samsung SIII Mini it says unlocked, but it ask for a pin? What number should I place him to use it.06/16/2013:This seller (Open Group Wireless) does not sell this phone unlocked. It happened to him via another buyer, as well as a relative of mine. I wonder if he is as responsible as to reward these people. I advise not to believe much.
+	I love every feature of this phone. It lets me do everything. The screen has a fast response. I'm writing the review with this phone. I would recommend this to anyone.i also suggest that you get a case because it scratches easily. Got this phone for $80 and it was absolutely worth the money.i just wish there was a front. But the camera is very good, but no flash.
+	I love this phone. I used to have android but the battery would die by afternoon. I frequently text on this phone, browse the web, use gps, and it lasts all day! It also does not freeze up like my old android phone used to. I have had this phone for about four months. I do not want any other phone! I like that it is so easy to customize and easy to use. The only drawback is that the camera quality is not that great - it blurs easily when you move and there is no flash. Even so, its still a good phone. Oh and no swype keyboard.
-	This phone would be fine if it worked. The first one would loose cell connection and had to be restarted multiple time a day. The second one would just randomly restart itself while in use. The third one freezes up completely forcing you to remove the battery to restart it and the soft touch keys are not back lit. Even though it is a low end phone, I still expect it to work. Is that too much to ask? Come on lucky number 4...
-	I've never written a review until now.... This phone has no apps except a crappy fb one with ads and a YouTube you can't hit show more videos button because its under an add and then to top it off the podcast don't work right and save onto your phone and fill up all the memory and the headphone jack broke within 6weeks. Now I have to buy another phone... Again...
-	When we found out we couldn't activate the phone and we couldn't return it that sucks!!!  I am still not satisfied!  What a waste of money and time.
-	The Nokia x6 is the worst phone i ever bought online. It keeps freezing up and turning off every day. Music playing and then stops unexpectedly. Internet too slow and can't even connect to wifi. I hate it and I feel like being ripped off of my money. Nokia this is the worst phone you ever manufactured and I ain't even gonna lie about it, but the battery is super good.
+	Great price for a very nice smartphone. I got one at $99 and just bought three more for my family at $79 each.Pros* Price. I do not know of a better value.You could get it at this price just to function as a music player. But a nice smartphone for just $79? Incredible!!!* Has the apps I need. I know that the Apple store has way more apps, but honestly, I am too busy to check the stock market every minute, or play the latest game, or watch some embarrassing video of a celebrity. I just need email, messaging, phone, calendar. The apps I need are here and work great.* Tile interface. I really, really like the tile interface. And I say that as a mac guy who has owned macs since the very first 128k mac in 1984. Everything looks so clean and organized. I have bigger square tiles for email, messages, phone and photos. This makes it super easy to use. I like it much better than the small icons on the iphone* Wifi calling/data. Great way to save on minutes and/or data* Windows Phone app. Loaded the free windows phone app on my macbook and then synced my music from itunes to the 521. Worked great.* Like the size* Speaker is better than I would have expected. Plenty of volume.Cons* Camera is kinda slow.Overall I am thrilled. And with Tmobile we are saving quite a lot over family plans on Verizon, ATT, and Sprint. And no contract.
+	So far so great. I love this phone.  It syncs perfectly with my windows computer and does everything I need it to.  The phone feels solid, the screen is vivid, and it has all the apps I need.  It's not an iPhone but for the price, it's definitely wonderful.  I also love that since it isn't an iPhone I don't have to worry about dropping it, losing it, scratching the screen...  It's easily replaceable for the price. I used the camera a few times and am excited about the panorama feature.  There is a circle that comes up to help you line up the sequence of images perfectly.
-	I really do not recommend this device it takes too much time to move from one menu to another, check other options with better processor
-	I bought this phone and say 4gb memory and not true, tare just 512 ram and 2GB of internal storage. Every so sends a message on screen saying "there is little storage" and not allowing install more applications, just the basics.yo compré este telefono y decía 4gb de memoria y no es verdad, tare apenas 512 de memoria ram y 2 gb de almacenamiento interno. A cada rato manda un mensaje por pantalla diciendo "queda poco almacenamiento" y no deja instalar más aplicaciones, solo lo basico.
-	After buying this phone, I used it less than a week before switching back to my Android.  You know all the annoying crashes, configuration problems, viruses, etc. that your Windows desktop PC has?  Well surprise surprise, Windows on a cell phone has all the same problems.  Do yourself a favor and get an Android or an iPhone because Microsoft does NOT know how to make cell phone software.
-	I actually got this as a replacement for my Galaxy Proclaim when I sent it back to straight talk due to charging issues.  Apparently they thought it would be a good trade.  I was impressed at first with the different features that made it better, however it is always lagging, and at times it can take up to 30 seconds to complete a call after it's already been selected to call.  I was willing to look over it, but now I have static issues due to my microphone.It is a terrible phone with impressive aspects.  Personally I don't think they tested it properly before issuing it.
+	Fantastic upgrade from a non-smart phone into an entry level smartphone, highly recommended for anyone who wants a cheap efficient upgrade. Even better than an iphone 3.
-	Ok.... First off I am a BIG fan of Nokia. I love there phones. They are quick, precise, and easy to use but sturdy too. At least until I got this phone. I have had this phone for 2 days now, and it stopped working on me. The first day after about 20 minutes of using it. It started asking me for prompts to put a pin in to use my sim card. That was fine, but it happened at least 10 times that day. So it got alittle tiring at the least.The second day worked ok. The third day, it started cutting off on me while texting. So I had to turn it back on, and it happened repeatedly. Until it finally died on me. Needless to say, I am going to buy a New E63 Nokia, bc my last phone was that. That phone was GREAT
-	Phone locked up after only 3 days. Slider won't work and can't find fixes on the internet. Cheap piece of crap!
+	This is a lot of phone for the price point.You will not be able to find anything better for this price point if you are looking for a cheap smart phone.
-	Do not buy this phone unless you want to keep replacing it. It's a great phone except for the fact that the right hinge breaks even if you never drop it. I'm on my 2nd phone and warranty's won't cover it. I give up on this phone.
-	Wasn't satisfied the phone itself was nice but it came with flaws like not being able to get or receive picture messages
+	Expensive smart phones and those frustrating restrictive long-term phone contracts are now in trouble. The technology really is getting better and cheaper. This phone is absolutely amazing for the price. I would not want Nokia to know but I would have paid 3 times the cost of this phone. It offers all of the features and benefit you want and need in a smart phone without the high cost. The data from my other phone (not a smart phone) was easily transferred and I was  immediately on the internet once I set it up and put in the battery. Plus I purchased the "straight talk" plan for unlimited database service with no contract for $45.00 a month. Wow.
-	i bought two cell phones and they sent me two balls and a few pens. I want my money back
-	You just sent me an email about the review guidelines. Customers don't really have the appetite to give great comments when they encounter terrible experience. I've seen plenty comments on your website that were even stronger than my comment on a whole bad experience. It does not matter if it is product or sales, the whole thing is a combination of customer satisfaction. You need to enhance customer experience and rather being negative on customer frustration.
-	Won't recommend to anyone doesn't work at all inside works good outside. Don't waste your money on it I used mine for a couple of hours and never used it again.
+	I bought this as a gift to my kid who was not happy at the first because of the price and thought got a cheap stuff, and then no complaints at all only after playing it for a while because found out this phone got all the whistle and bells that are necessary for a smart phone, it can be used as practically any modern gadget.  I found only issue it might have is the windows system, there not much apps available for it currently, unlike Android phone, there are tons of apps on Google play and many other sites.  You would need a window 8 machine if you are able to develop some apps for yourself.  All such phone devices collect finger prints and more, unless one does not want a screen protector, this is not really an issue.
-	Terrible garbling off and on of my voice to others and others to me off and on. Do not buy this phone! I also miss the nuances of peoples voices using this phone, leading to awkwardness. I hate this phone! I am only keeping it because I threw the box away and can't get my money back from AT&T.; As soon as I can afford a different phone, this goes in the trash.Edited to add: I later bought two inexpensive stick-on antenna boosters on Amazon that helped somewhat. The problem might even be with AT&T;'s service, in addition to the phone itself. I have used this in the city (at the house I had when phone was purchased) and out in the country (new house I moved to). I am now less than 2 miles from a tower and similar problems both locations, and also when traveling.I later added these two cheap antenna boosters and though they did not give me more bars showing signal strength, my calls are no longer garbled most of the time, and my calls do not drop unexpectedly.[...][...]
-	I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.
+	This smart phone is perfect for the people who are not looking for high end cell phones(IPhone, Samsung).  You can add microSD card upto 64gb if needed and doesn't come with one.  I charge the phone every night.  Making calls(including wifi calling), GPS(free HERE map 2.9gb for all of US), emails (Yahoo, microsoft live, outlook), facebook works fine, weather channel etc, all very good.  I have also used the phone to watch video tutorials and it is okay.  Windows 8 phone(no negatives).  The picture quality is excellent.  Operation is not complicated either.
-	I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.  Thought I was reviewing the phone.  But anyway, this phone is cheap.  I got it for my husband because he needed a new phone, and he did not like it.  It requires a micro sim card which it does not state in the description.  Plus it does not let you change the background color.  Only black.  Boring.  You can change the box colors, but my husband wanted wallpapers, which it does not do.  He did not like the setup and we ended up sending it back.
-	Phone looks new, but shows calls in call history. Its not a new phone as advertised.Also does not charge, not with the charger, nor via usb connection.I have contacted seller and I'm waiting for response.
+	I like T-Mobile's no-contract plans and love Windows Phone, so this phone is the only choice.  Since it is a low end  Windows Phone from Nokia, I did not have high expectations.  I have been using it for a month, but am yet to find anything to complain about. It is light, but solid, fast.  Audio is clear, photo and video are excellent.  The Nokia apps that come with the phone are great. For example, I bet that HERE Drive with turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation and 3-D map can match or beat most standalone GPS Navigators.  It is unbelievable that one can get such an excellent phone for a little over $100.
-	I got this phone for free from Verizon and it still felt like a ripe off. It shuts down when it wants to. Kinda hard to figure out what does what. Getting and sending files is a pain. Worst phone i've ever had.
-	Phone came with the screen broken and was in a really bad condition, i asked for my money back and im still waiting for an answer!!! Dont watste your money like i did!!!!
-	This phone is horrible. Dont reward them for the poor design and functionality. The phone shuts off randomly at least 3 times per week. Several reviewers have noted this same phenomenon. Search for it on google and you will see the same.Also transferring images (which the camera is like seeing an 80s home video) from your phone to your computer is a disaster. You would think you would be able to select all the images at once, or at least click the top one, hold shift, and select the bottom one. But thats not possible. You have to manually choose every picture you need to transfer from your phone. They added a sync button but only from the PC to the phone, not the other way around.The app store is a joke compared to android and iphone. You can only setup 1 custom screen, then the next screen is a full list of all your applications in alphabetical order, so you cant re-arrange them or create multiple screens like you can for android. I cant get over how crappy this phone is, and dont understand how this can get so many positive reviews. I am totally and completely unsatisfied. I wont even give it to my teenager, Id rather trash it.
+	I bought this phone from Metro PCS for 29 dollars after 20 dollar rebate. When I first got my computer with windows 8.1 I wasn't sure I was going to like 8.1 but after getting used to it I really like the new windows. Now to have a phone with windows 8 and seeing how easy it is to work, I'm glad I bought it. For 29 dollars you can't go wrong. Of course it doesn't  have all the bells and whistles, but if you uses it for just the basics this is a great phone. It's fast, the bluetooth pairs easily, and the speech recognition works perfectly. The only thing I didn't like was the toolbar at the bottom doesn't have a back light but for 29 dollars it's a minor flaw. So if you want a great smart phone for little money this is the one. One other thing is that it's a Nokia and I've always had good luck with that brand.  Update: Now that I've had this phone for over a month I thought I'd give you an update. This was the best 29 dollars I've ever spent. I can't believe what a great phone this is. I usually buy mid priced phones because I'm not a 17 year old that needs to have all the bells and whistles. I could never justify spending 5-6 hundred dollars on a phone, like the saying goes - a fool and his money are soon parted - (Steve Jobs probably will have this put on his grave stone). Getting back to the subject - this phone has everything you'll ever need. People complain about the amount of apps available - how many apps do you need. There are some great apps available and more on the way. The voice recognition is amazing for this priced phone and I can't believe how much i like Windows 8. Windows 8 is so simple to use, I don't think I'll ever go back to android or ios. The only draw back is that it's not a fast web browser, but if your like me, I do all of my web browsing on my computer. So take it from a person who only writes reviews if the product is really good or really bad - you'll love this phone.
+	OMG, i love this phone. the price, the software, hardware everything. The speakers is even louder than my iPod touch 5th Generation. So Happy I bought this phone after been sick of Android software and hardware. Thanks Amazon, Windows and goodguy electronics.
-	i probably got a defective phone. the mic is not working out of the box. i can hear well but the other person doesn't hear me when i am on the phone. so its either the mic or the receiver or something that's not working.
+	This is a nice little phone.  Very easy to see and user friendly.  I am not only the cellphone constantly but it does everything I need and then some.
-	My phone was stolen 2 weeks ago.  I called Verizon and they recommended ordering a phone from Amazon, for a much lesser price.  So I found a "brand new" I-phone 4 for $190.  I ordered it and received it 4 days after the "2 Day shipping" I paid extra for.  When the phone showed up it was in a brown unmarked box, there was no invoice, no receipt, just a slip from, "HQ Select." This was my first indication that something didn't seem right.  I turned on the phone, got into my i-cloud and everything looked normal, normal; EXCEPT that I had a different phone number and it could not be changed.  I called Verizon and they told me the phone was linked to another account and it was unusable (they verified this through the MEID settings in your i-phone).  So HQ Select sold me a phone that was someone else's and I could not use it at all.  Amazon could do nothing but offer me an advanced refund.  Verizon recommended, "hard erasing the phone immediately and sending it back." The number associated with the phone was a verizon wireless carrier and the sales rep told me that this person just got a new phone activated with the same number.  I did a hard reset and bought a new phone from Verizon.  Here's the bottom line: When ordering a phone from Amazon for, "much less" than the normal price; Make sure its definitely not from HQ Select, double check the third party vendor is legit, or just make sure its from Amazon and not affiliated with a third party vendor.  I hope HQ Select gets an inoperable tumor at the base of their spine and they rot in hell.
-	It is not designed for the USA. It is for Europe because:1- Outlet is not fit to power points of the USA2- Many applications are not in EnglishAltogether I regret !!1
-	Este equipo es CDMA, por esta razón nunca lo podré utilizar, sucede que en las especificaciones del producto no estaba la palabra CDMA y por eso lo compré. Lástima por que de ser GSM sería una muy buena adquisición.
+	He is very experienced with tech and loves the phone.  great apps & camera & screen.  recommend it to anyone
-	It took me 5 tries to get the SIM card installed correctly.  I don't think I am an idiot.  I can't believe they designed the SIM card keying to be so confusing and ambiguous.I was going to use this phone as my iphone back up or as a smart phone for my dad.  It can't fit either use case.After I finally got the card configured and Tmobile set up, I played with the phone for 15 minutes.  The UI was too confusing for me.  After trying it out, I refuse to try out a Nokia or Microsoft phone again.To add to my annoyance, I had to call the Microsoft return phone system 5 times and go through a different menu path than I was supposed to before I could finally get a person.  I think they programmed their automated phone system to automatically drop all calls related to phone returns and purposefully pretend to not recognize valid order numbers.  What a joke for a product and company.
-	The phone looked good, but unfortunately to our surprise the callers could not hear us. You can turn on the speaker but they can barely hear us. The phone texts fine. I looked into exchanging it but I had to write the seller, so they can approve a exchange or return. I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM!!! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THAT SELLER AGAIN.!!!
+	Phones like this really make you think why people pay 7-800 dollars for an iphone or android. For the money, this phone is the best phone out there; nothing in the 300$ price range comes close to this phone. The user friendly interface and solid design make for an incredible phone.
+	I have used for several days, it runs very well and is really a cost-efficient smart phone. As mentioned, the battery is not quite strong, but could be aquired.
-	I do not like this phone because it does not work - need to find out what can I do about this phone.Can I still return it?
+	I cannot say enough GOOD about this phone.. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE it.. My husband bought a Samsung Galaxy Blaze, as he had one that got broken.. and we were looking for nbew phones. I purchased MINE from Amazon,com, and got it WAY faster, than his from Ebay.. My phone is BETTER qaulity, I LOVE the features, soo easy to use, and I LOVE that I can personalize the tiles on the front... It is a win win for me!! Now hubby say's... "I should have gotten a phone like yours.. YEP.. and paid LESS too!! HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!!
+	The phone was as described in the ad, new in the retail box. Everything arrived with the phone was also new. I bought the phone to use with my current t-mobile number, however my old phone had a regular sim and not the micro sim that this phone uses. I took the phone and my old sim to a t-mobile store near me, and the guy there transferred my number to the micro sim that came with the phone. So, don't through away the sim that comes with the lumia 521; you might need it if your old phone doesn't have a micro sim card.
-	I bought this over amazon and I was told this phone was brand new. The exact words used. The phone was used and opened and broke. It powers down over and over. I can charge it to full it lasts on for about a hour than starts turning on and off over and over. The seller was not honest. but I will say the company took care of me and sent me a new one. And they are billing the sender for it. I love nokia. This is a great phone.
-	This phone gets 1 star. The camera/video are excellent.  Battery life is excellent.  It's a good thing that the back comes off very easily because it is needed to take the battery out, then back in because the phone constantly freezes. What's up with the airplane mode coming on at random? Hellz if I know. Sometimes the phone gets hot. These were suppose to be brand new phones, but could possibly be refurbished. The phone came with a quick start up instruction manual, but did not come with the actual booklet. Is that the way new phones come nowadays? No booklet? The headphones that came with it? One line for ears is wayyyy longer than the other. Is that how they are made these days? It's been a few years since I have bought a phone.  I have downloaded a few things on my phone, like pandora music. Out of the blue, one morning as I was getting up, The phone blasted out music. Scared the shist outta me.  I began laughing because I was feeling a little down, and the song that came on was, "Keep your head up," by Tupac Shakur. Perfect timing. Made my day lol.  There is something called Picasa, that I have never heard of which is on the phone. It plays music @ random also. LOL good tunes. I accidentally learned about a new radio station. Sometimes the voice dialer comes on to dial someones number. One day, there was a button that popped up, which tells you how to use the phone, but I was busy. Went to check it out later, but can't find the darn button. lol jokes on me. Guess I could go online to download some freakn instructions or go to T Mobile and ask for a book, which they will probably charge me for.  Sometimes the phone does a random dial. I can't figure out why because it has an annoying automatic security screen lock that can't be bypassed.  What is really annoying is my 73 year old mother constantly calling to tell me that her phone is acting up. I have to guide her through on what to do. Two phones, $139.00 a piece. Don't make the mistake of buying it, unless you want to use the phone as a camera or video. There are other things, but I am too busy to write more. I hope you future buyers get the picture.
-	The device itself is fine as long as it works. Less than a year, one day it did not work at all... no response... nothing except a dim flash of red LED on top when trying to start it.The worse part is that it is not covered for support in the united states. They refer you to hear and there and finally you are left with a dead piece. Sad.
-	They offered the phone as it was NEW and really was refurbished and in no-good condition. Incompleted without battery !!!
-	Worse phone ever does not work. Ends calls with notice, phone freezes up. requested a refund was denied had use phone for 1 month and its defective...DO NOT BUY!!!
+	Great phone for the price. I wasn't sure I wanted to go with a Windows phone, but my old MyTouch 4g android wasn't lasting a day even after a second battery. Seems to have better battery life (2x charge a week vs 1.5x a day). I'll spring for a fancier one when I need it, but otherwise great despite a lack of camera flash/led.One downside is that I had to spend $10/mo more for wifi sharing vs my android out of box. I'm sure its by passable, but sometimes you need wifi hotspots immediately.
-	Buyers beware for the above cell phone i.e samsung galaxy note ii GT-N7100- FACTORY UNLOCK--16GB GRAY.  The phone in question has no in-built sim card, like AT& T,AND T MOBILE. The seller is not being sincere and was trying to deceive buyers . This information is for whosoever may want to buy this phone.
-	I kinda got it wet and there was water inside the phone and now I think it won't work anymore. that or the battery :P
+	I bought this phone for a very specific purpose; wifi calling.  I'm one of those legacy Tmo customers stuck in a contract, the only problem is that I get no reception at work, so rather than pay the $200 cancellation fee and go to a more expensive carrier I bought the 521 to use the wifi calling app.  After some working things out I finally got it to work and now am pleased with the phone.Here are the steps I had to take:1. Enable wifi calling for my account on tmobile.com2. Update my 911 location in my account settings on tmobile.com.After those two steps I turned the App on, switched to "wifi calling preferred" and it works like a charm.
+	My first smart phone. My adult children both have iphones, but I am more frugal, I guess. The Nokia Lumina works fine. Took a while to get used to the functions. I have had it for about 6 weeks. The battery is a little weak.  Overall, though, it fits my needs to be able to access web, keep calendar, music, videos, games.  The Windows system is pretty intuitive.  I give it a B+.
-	how could a 700 dollar phone have such cheap screen.  I know why samsuch make the screen so cheap, its because they want people to keep on spending 150 dollars on after market parts so they can rake in as much cash as possible.  Its horrible that we as consumers let these companies do these things to us.
+	I have been using Android phones and an Apple iPod touch for a few years now and have enjoyed both very much. Lately I have been reading some good press on the Nokia Windows phones and wanted to give it a try. What also got me very interested was that Nokia phones have traditionally had good hardware. I had been using a Samsung Galaxy S Blaze for about a year now and it's been solid but a bit slow. I chose it over faster cell phones because I like a phone that can go a day or two on a full charge. My wife's Samsung Galaxy 2 has a great screen but you better have a charger and a current supply around because extended use will drain it quickly. My Samsung Galaxy also an annoying problem when trying to connect to my built in Bluetooth speaker system in my car. I would have to turn the Samsung Bluetooth on and off to get it connected. This problem never occurred using my older Motorola phone.Anyway, ordered the Lumia 521 and figured I could sell it on eBay if it was a dog. I got it last Friday, July 26 and have been using it a lot.This phone is really great: it's very fast and the ability to create a custom display with what you really use makes it super easy and frustration free. No more endless side swiping to get to the app you currently need because the Windows animated tiles show what you want in the way you want. Many of the tiles function as small video screens that display information status related to the app. After using it a while I realized how limited the swiping system is in both iOS and Android.I cannot emphasis how useful and functional this is it real life when you need to get things done efficiently. Microsoft doesn't communicate this effectively and perhaps people are so conditioned to swipe, swipe, swipe to get what they want that no other way seems possible. But it really offers an extremely effective way to monitor the many information streams that mobile phones can provide. You can design a kind of information cockpit with important streams where you want them and less important info streams in a view able but less conspicuous location. And this increased efficiency translates in a better user experience.I found the interface design beautiful in terms of legible fonts and colors. A pleasure to use. Touch screen is very sensitive and fast, fast, fast. And linking up to my car's hands off Bluetooth system is quick. By the time I turn on the car engine and back out my driveway, it is always connected. No more Bluetooth tag to get a working connection.For another viewpoint, Google "Wozniak praises windows phone".Battery easily lasts a day.Built in speaker has plenty of volume. The 521 camera is OK, not great and there is no built in flash. For a better camera, look to the Nokia Lumia 925 with Carl Zeiss lens. For now I really don't care to spend the $$ as the pictures are good enough.This weekend I'll put my Samsung Galaxy S Blaze up for sale. Works great but I am keeping the Windows phone.
-	The phone itself was terrible from the features to the actual 'click' touch screen i think that's the worst part. If you text a lot this phone is not for you. I return this phone a month and a half ago and still haven't got a refund. Customer Support is even more terrible they all apologies but no clear actions have been taken. If you plan to purchase a product from this merchant and don't like your product I sure hope this doesn't happen to you.
-	I ordered this phone. When I received it, I received that it was falsely advertised. It came in a sealed box and looked brand new, but when I checked the total memory on the phone it had 10GB is the total memory and 9.72GB was available for use because there were some preloaded apps that had use a small amount of memeory out of the 10GB. The sell ad said it had 16GB total. When I contacted the buyer, the tried to belittle my intelligence stating that they was 16GB on the phone, but the apps was taking up the 6GB of the 16GB making it 10GB left. First of all the know this difference between total GB on a cell phone and avaliable memory after some memory has been used by apps. I told them this. From the beginning, they gave me the run around for days before responding and then refused to give me a refund. Also there is something wrong with the backlight. BEWARE OF THIS BUYER, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE PRODUCT SEEM TO BE SOME DEFECTIVE CELL PHONES THAT SAMSUNG ARE SELLING TO THESE TYPE OF BUYERS JUST TO GET RID OF.
+	Although I wish it had flash for the camera, however the phone works great. The windows os has really grown on me. Definitely worth the money. Its a great buy and I highly recommend it.
+	I had a samsung note 3 through verizon and found this phone after I decided to switch to a differenr carrier, so I do have first hand experience with the other product..there is absolutely no difference and this phone is a fraction of the price. the features are all there, multiwindow tasking..it is missing polaris office but i never used that program anyway..all the google features are there, and all my apps from my previous phone downloaded to this one and work perfectly. The phone is sturdy and very well made surprisingly. The leather back says synthetic leather but is soft and supple not that plastic kind. The speaker for media also does a great job..i ordered the phone directly from ulefone..i recieved an extra battery, a smart view case and the regular back as well. My single negative on this phone is that the stylus doesnt match the quality of the phone. It's very cheaply made. But with the 400 I just saved I don't mind buying a better one
-	This phone should be a great phone but sadly it falls flat on its face. The 960x540 screen is nice though not HD and the build quality is about what you'd expect from a sub $250 phone. Unfortunately everything else is sub-par. Video recording studders along at 14FPS at 1080p, my almost 3 year old LG G2X has 1/3 the processing power and can record 1080p at 24FPS no problem. The camera has horrible lag time between hitting the shutter button and taking the picture. Possibly the worst of all is the mic, there is a LOUD pop when it first starts recording audio either thru the audio recording app or when recording video but thats not all folks If the ear dum shattering pop was not enough there is a loud whine to acompany the entirety of what ever you record that makes up abou 65% of the ambient sound. As a froogle gadget junkie who has made a lot of bad purchases in the past this is easily my biggest regret.
+	The Nokia is a great purchase, the phone is easy to navigate and stylish.  I would recommend this  phone to all mom's for their children!
-	The phone freezes up alot even with all the apps not running.  Seems like a knock off phone but its not, if ya know what i mean.
+	This is a very nice phone for the money. Very easy to use. Both my husband and I have them.
-	I had really hoped this would work - 600 free minutes of talk, text and data via an hsn deal and just got my answer today. What a piece of crapola.YOU CANNOT ACCESS IN ANY WAY HOW MANY MINUTES OR SERVICE DAYS YOU HAVE LEFT VIA THE PHONE.Please read that sentence to yourself 10 times before you buy this piece of slop. If you want to find out if you have enough minutes left to make a call, well SURPRISE!!!! You have to go to ST or Tracfone's website to enter the phone number/partial serial number and THEN you are finally provided with the info.I literally had a mentally defective Tracfone representative (well that was redundant)tell me that in order to keep track of my minutes and data usage, I should 'write it down on a piece of paper'. I swear to god, I am not making this up.And as far as I can tell, there is also ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO SEARCH YOUR MUSIC VIA VOICE COMMAND. God almighty! Can't Tracfone/Straighttalk do anything right? Have a TMobile Prism that I thought I would return for this deal from Tracfone, but after one half day trying this junk out, and dealing with reps at Tracfone and hsn who haven't a clue about the phone or its functions, I am now willing to pay more for a phone that actually works.If you buy this....thing!, may god have mercy on your soul...but don't say you weren't warned!
-	Nowhere's did it mention, or clearly state, in the description, that the phone doesn't work with Verizon. I travel a lot overseas and have two phones. One with Verizon (Blackberry) and the other with Vodaphone (generic phone), both of which, I believe are ultimately the same company. I get this new phone and open the package and inside is a note stating that it doesn't work with Verizon or T-Mobile. I wasted my money.
-	I bought this phone for that said Factory Unlocked, but I get is Telefonica Europe of Orange, the same does not work with 3g signal, the signal at times does not work. I bought another phone Samsung SIII mini of other seller and this doesn't have these problems. This is really a scam in the ad says unlocked but is not true.
+	great cellphone excellent conditions brand new! thanks you.Fast & furious AAA+++ great communication. I will recommend this phone because is a great machine.
-	Note 2 is very very breakable! To repair only the glass you have to spend 200 euro, because glass and LCD are note separaple. Sorry but i think that this product is a scam. Beautiful but too breakable to buy and too expensive to repair.
-	I specifically chose unlocked cell phone cause i live in Trinidad and as such my daughters will be using a Trinidad cellular service provider. When I received the phone and put in my daughters' old sim cards in the both phones I am getting the error message "This sim card can only be used on specific networks. Contact your customer service center for the unlock code. 10 attempts remainingI went into B-Mobile one of our local service provider and brought two new sim card, on installing the new sim cards and restarting phones the same error messages were received again on both phone. Very Very disappointing.On re-visiting your website today I am see Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile) under your unlock phone selection list with no clear label as with other phones under this selection list just as per my purchase/order, clearly something is wrong here as stated earlier the phone isnt unlocked as your website displays it to be. I now have to decide if to attempt to return both phones or get both unlocked, very unsatisfed
-	Phone worked for one day and never turned back on the next day after it being fully charged, asked for a new battery to see if that was the problem but nope it still never turned on even after leaving it charging for a day, returning and getting money back! Not a good phone at all! Returning it is time consuming so don't even take the chance!
+	Awesome phone especially for the price and you don't have to have a contract!  This was my second smartphone (after the 520) and it was a great experience.  It allowed me to check emails fast and do other things well.The 520 is also a great phone but AT&T; is a little expensive in their plans so I ended up unlocking the 520 phone (AT&T; unlocked it for me for free) and using it with T-mobile.  It worked with T-mobile but the data had some minor problems with the T-mobile network so I ended up getting the Lumia 521 which is almost an identical phone.Differences between the Lumia 520 and 521:  Lumia 520:  520 is slightly smaller in length  Has a dark gray backside (almost black)  optimized for AT&T;  Locked to AT&T; unless otherwise specified  AT&T; will unlock it with little hassle  Fits into the 521 case with a little extra wiggle room  Contains a Go-phone sim included  Even when unlocked wouldn't process T-mobile data  Lumia 521:  Has an off-white backside  optimized with T-mobile network  T-mobile makes you jump through a few hoops to unlock this one  Most cases you buy online (even if they say they are for the 520) are actually made for the 521  Contains a T-mobile sim card  I think this one has a headset capability not available in the 521 (not sure)  A little bit of a pain to set up because of T-mobile but once it was set up no major issuesCONCLUSION:  I would get the 521 because T-mobile has a cheaper monthly rate.  The 521 doesn't look as good because of the off-white backside but you can get a case for $5 (see my other review) and cover up the back.Note: Don't let the T-mobile (or AT&T;) rep con you.  There should be no activation/set-up fee.  They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
-	I saw this phone and fell in love with it, so I ordered it. It has been a night mare. Bad reception, speakers are terrible, NO space to download anything. I have downloaded only one thing and there is no room for anything else. I wanted to download more bible material, but after I downloaded the bible, oh well that was all my room. Can not send pic but can receive them. On a scale of 1-10 this phone gets a 1. Can't afford to change it now, but as soon as I can its out of my life!!! Can anyone help me please. Would love to send it back, but I think I had it to long now.
-	I've had three of these "smart" phones and they've all displayed the annoying habit of getting progressively worse with time.  Unresponsive screen, apps that don't run properly, quirky behaviors like starting up apps on its own, and slow responses to any commands are just a few of the problems I encountered while using this phone. Motorola's choice of having batteries that cannot be replaced ensures that in a few months this phone becomes a bona fide plug in device.  By the fifth month my Razr was running the battery down in less than one hour (and that's with all battery saver options engaged).  I was literally counting the minutes until my contract with Verizon would come up so I could upgrade.Oh one more thing, when I used the Verizon Wireless website calculator to figure out how much the phone was worth, it came up with an amount of $4.76 -- I could not agree more - that's about how much I would pay to get another one of these!
+	I love my Nokia Lumia 521!  This is my first smartphone and I love it!!!  It is so easy to use.  That being said, I did have a lot of problems getting it set up.  To be clear, (because I wasn't when I bought this) it IS a locked phone with T-Mobile.  I did have to pay cellunlocker.com to unlock the phone.  They did (for a fee).  I use this phone with Straight Talk and I did have to purchase their SIM card.  Due to T-Mobile not being available in my area, I had to purchase the At&t; compatible Straight Talk SIM card.  Once I got all these ducks in a row, the phone works like a charm!!  I absolutely love it!!
-	would not use the 4G offered by my provider, used the slowest internet available, & could not change the settings, slowest phone ever
-	I ordered this phone in blue for 219.00 and i received the same model but in grey which costs 49.00 dollars less than the blue color and now the sender it's telling me that the grey costs more and it's not true i just finished looking the phone right now, and it costs 176.98 in grey. I am so mad!! i just want my money back or a refund for the difference of the cost.
+	For anyone who is thinking of buying this phone do your homework! I originally bought this phone on the T-Mobile network, I was able to get the phone unlocked and am now using it on the AT&T; network. This phone beats android phones hands down in performance. No lagging, freezing or any of the other crap you get from android. I love the look and feel of this phone. I love how if you have windows 8 on your computer the photos sync, no using a usb cable. This phone has the best camera, and the sound is clear and crisp. I love listing to music on the phone speaker quality is great. Great phone! Nokia has done a great job once again with this phone
+	Got this phone from T-Mobile yesterday, just switched over from at&t.; I was hoping to get the Lumia 925 (I'm a huge fan of windows phones), but it just seems like its taking Nokia forever to release them. Since I can no longer use my old lumia900 due to a broken screen, I needed something immediately. Still planning on getting the 925 once it comes out, I decided to go with the cheapest phone with 4g capacity.After a day of use, I really started fall in love with it.Things I really liked about it: lumia 521 is pretty light in my opinion. It feels a lot lighter than my old 900. The touch screen is super sensitive. In the manual, it says it works with gloves on. I tried, and it works great. The camera is also decent. I mean, its only 5mp, so I didn't expected much. But the noise in the picture is very low even with high ISO. it comes with a panorama app which i liked a lot. The time between shots are still a bit long, but it has this smartphoto app that takes four consecutive shots, which helped to solve the problem to a certain degree. It has wifi calling. I actually had never used this function on any other phones before, I'm not sure if lumia 900 has it, so I don't have anything to compare the quality of wifi calling with. It has removable batteries. The back cover is not the easiest thing to take off, but you know you can if you really need to. I really like the feel of the back cover as well.But there are a few things I don't like. Nokia really could have place the power button at a different place or at least change the side design. With the curve on the side, I always feel the phone is slipping out of my hand when I press the power button. There's no flash and no front camera. It does not have 4g LTE, but even the iphone 4s doesn't, so I think this is alright. And plus, 4G is really not slow at all.So bottom line is, you know you are not getting the most advanced phone in the world when you bought it, and you know this isn't something that's gonna blow your friends' mind when they see it. But  if you on a budget, or need a temporary phone that is not gonna put you too far behind all the mobile technologies, nothing beats lumia 521.I'm paying $85 a month right now for 2 lines. $50(My line)+ $30(My girlfriend's line) + $5 (the monthly installment for lumia 521). This is about half of what I was paying last month with at&t.;
-	OK, so I know this is supposed to be a review of the phone; it's hardware and software. And after a month testing it out on a prepaid plan, I knew this would fit my family's needs and I was ready to go. However, for cellphones the full experience is directly linked to the wireless provider. So, despite  my admiration for this Nokia phone and Microsoft Windows, I am giving it one star. Yesterday I called TMobile to activate a family plan with four lines and port from ATT. This is where things turned sour. After two hours of frustrating customer service, 4 different phonecalls, 6-8 different representatives, one dropped call (they hung up on me after I requested to talk to a supervisor), and numerous annoying attempts to reassure me that everything would be fine, I gave up. This might be an isolated issue and my bad luck. It seems things went wrong when my address, in a new development, would not be recognized in their system. This technical issue made it impossible for them to complete the activation. So because of the poor customer service I am sticking with ATT. I simply do not trust tmobile to make this a smooth experience. And I advise you to reconsider switching to tmobile. It might not be worth the hassle.
-	I was told that I would be receiving a t-mobile phone and I received a Metro-PCS phone.  I had to wait for a full refund and then just bought it from a T-mobile provider.  I was extremely disappointed because I had to go a whole two extra weeks without a phone thanks to their mix up in information.
+	I'm a big fan of iOS and this is a much better choice than Android. I still use iOS for my mobile trading but WP should see development  down the road. So other than trading this is a much better GUI for all your day to day communications. For those that will use t-mobile one cool feature is wifi calling so if you have a weak cell signal at home your still good. I turn off cell data and use my Skype Number and have a $2 daily plan and only get charged when I use my t-mobile number. This is a great way to have a home phone and cell service on demand. For FYI you can check your t-mobile voice mail from another number and not be charged for the day which is nice. You just hit star and enter your pin like all cell voice mails.Your phone will ring when it's on but if you don't answer there's no charge even with cell data off which you need to do in settings. I install a connection app to make it easy. If you like the daily plan idea just remember cell data must be off and do not answer your incoming call unless you want to pay for that day which ends at midnight then starts a new day. So far I would recommend this phone but plan to get my wife a 1020 and use it with straight talk. $45 a month unlimited everything but data throttled at 2.5 gig which really is a bargain.
+	It's a great little phone, and at a great price. Sure it might not take the highest quality pictures, have a forward facing camera, or a rear flash, but as phones go, it's great. I can make calls and send texts, which are the basic requirement of a phone. The audio quality is fantastic, and the built-in speaker produces a great and loud sound. It also gets better coverage on the same network from my old phone, so that's another plus to it.As Windows mobile goes, sure it might not have all the fancy new apps that come out for Android or the iPhone, but there are work arounds for most of them, and the ones that you can't find you probably don't need. The functionality of the OS is spot on for my needs in the overall.The battery and the touch screen are really my only two downsides to it. The battery life is great if you're like me and you don't use the phone for constant gaming, video streaming, etc. I usually get around two days of charge when I use it as a simple phone. However, if you're into gaming or need to stream lots of videos, the batter sucks. I tend to get about four or five hours out of the battery when playing games or streaming, and that's using the power saver mode. However, the battery is accessible, meaning you might be able to replace it with a higher capacity model.As for touch screen, it can be a little unresponsive at times. Unless you game significantly on your phone, this is really a non-issue, but I had to include it for the gamers out there.On the whole, it's an entry level smart phone. It's missing features available on more expensive models, but that's the price of cutting costs. The battery life isn't the greatest, however it seems decent in comparison to higher level phones, and smart phones have never been really known for phenomenal battery performance as an item. For the price though, it's a solid phone that can call and text, has the ability to download apps, and can connect to the internet. If you're looking for a smart phone on a budget and you don't necessarily mind using Windows Mobile 8 instead of Android, this is the phone for you.
+	It is plenty of smart phone for me and it was affordable. I am finding the camera a bit slow but I am not very patient with learning.I would recommend it to my friends.I am sure I have only begun to learn the many things I can do with my new phone.
+	As part of my work, I've used or had experience with a huge variety of smart phones and tablets. This is one of the very best.I am so deeply impressed by this mobile operating system. The hardware has a replacable battery, microSD card, USB media support, etc. I got this phone for my daughter; my wife has the 920. This phone compares well with its big brother, although it lacks a flash, NFC, and wireless charging, it has a replaceable battery and expandable storage (micro SD inside the case).The "people" function, once set up, is breathtaking; it has good parental controls (nonexistent or at best difficult on most mobile devices), is visually beautiful, has great voice-control, decent apps (great games--better than any other mobile platform), integrates with XBox and other platforms, etc., etc.
+	In $74 I got everything.exactly good phone.it's working good.Thanks Nokia..First time I'm using windows phone.I'm happy with this phone.Thanks again Nokia
-	when I bought it it said very good condition, when it came it was pretty bad. It was not charging, scratches all over. I had to return it.
-	This is probably the worse phone I have ever had.  It is not user friendly at all. I have not downloaded many apps and do not use many apps. I don't use the bluetooth and only use data when I have wifi access.  I know this is not the galaxy 111 but based on the high ratings on Samsung phones I really expected better performance.  I just switched from a blackberry, but this is really disappointing.  Not even the basic features like making a call works well.  Its just two months and I really cannot put up with this for much longer.  Think I will go Iphone.Pros:  Nice size phone- attractive.cons:  The buttons on either side of the centre menu buttons do not light up and takes very long to respond when pressed.  There is no way to cut off or end a call other than waiting until the touch screen pops up with the end button which takes quite a while after you have dialed - this has resulted in the  person on the other end hearing me for at least 15 seconds after I think I have ended the calls.  Battery life started out really great for the 1st three weeks or so giving me at least 2 days without charging using wifi and apps.  Now - about 2 weeks later its down to less than a  day- I have to charge daily.  The dual sim does not allow you to  pick which sim to call from - it has to be set on 1 at a time and to change you have to go to the settings options and change it.  I had dual sim phones before and when you dialed a number there was an option to choose which sim to dial from.  For incoming calls it automatically diverts the calls from the sim which is not set, to the sim which is set without the callers knowing that their call is going to another carrier.Difficult to store numbers in the phone book - in fact from time to time I am unable to access some numbers which I know were stored and I did not delete. contacts which were automatically stored as SNS cannot be edited.Sometimes you dial a number, and press call- it just diverts back to the main menu- this happens regularly now.The list goes on.....I definitely will not recommend this phone.
+	I purchased this Nokia Lumia 521 because of the cheap price and I have not ever had a smartphone before so I did not want to spend a ton of cash on a product in case I decided I didn't like it.This one sold for $99 which is the same price Microsoft is selling it for so that was a GREAT DEAL! So for the price I can credit the seller and I am glad to see this price is the best on amazon.com.The phone is easy to use, the screen home page is tiled and you can arrange it anyway you want. The phone comes with an initial screen protector showing the labels for all the buttons however these buttons are not labeled on the case so I left it on for a few days until I memorized what each button does.I purchased the sim kit from walmart for the $30 month unlimited data and 100 mins of voice. The trick with that is you must sign up as a new phone number and pick this option, it is ONLY for NEW accounts. This option only appears once during sign up and so you can't change your plan to the $30 plan later. The sim kit MUST be purchased from Walmart.The phone comes with a sim kit in the box, so if you want the walmart deal you'll have to leave the sim from the box alone until you put in the walmart sim card.The phone worked right out of the box without a sim card using it's wifi capabilities. I was able to connect to my home wifi without any problem. Only 911 calls can be made without the sim card but you can still use the internet and search the app store.Once the phone was setup I was able to use the full features without a problem. I did find that the phone probably needs to be rebooted at least 1 time a day or the OS starts to get laggy when switching around different screens. Either it is the windows OS or one of the other apps on the phone so I can't say if the windows OS is slow. Most of the time the OS works smoothly and the touch screen is sensitive so you barely need to touch it, I am sure that will preserve the screen longer so it's a good feature.I tested the camera out and it took good photos indoors without any flash. As others have said this phone does not have a flash but the digital camera can handle most low light situations. If you use the Nokia Smart camera feature that was a good way to capture a good photo in low light, it snaps a series of quick photos and you can pick the best one to keep. There are a lot of good photo editing software already included and some very nice free photo editing apps in the app store.Since the phone is from Microsoft it helps if you have an account with msn, you can sign up and the phone is tied right in to the sky drive features where you can store you photos, media and documents nicely as well as have access to your hotmail or msn email accounts. Also the messenger from msn works on this phone.Google has a smaller presence on this phone as can be expected with the competition however there is some great gps applications and I loved the nokia music app, it streams radios or offers an offline radio feature, on top of that if you swipe through the screens it will locate live music events in your area! How cool is that!?Now for the downside, as you know this is not an iPhone or a galaxy. Unfortunately it is very hard to find accessories at any local shops for the Nokia Lumia 521. Even if they sell the phone they will say they do not carry accessories for it so you will best spend your time on amazon.com, Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases. There are some standard features which makes this phone compatible with a generic min usb phone charger. Actually I did find a small vendor at the local mall that had protective case for the Nokia Lumia 521 but it was so limited just 4 basic colors and none of the variety I found on amazon.com. Purses and pouches are a different story, most of those created a product that can be used with a generic smartphone size and this phone fits right in most of those items without a problem. I'd suggest just testing the phone pouches first before buying though to make sure.Another downside which was very disappointing to me was that I could not use the amazon cloud player app on this phone so I can not listen to my mp3 which are in my amazon digital vault. Very disappointed about that, but there is an amazon shopping app and the kindle app also works on this phone so that's indicating to me that soon I will be able to use the amazon cloud player as well.So speaking of the app store you have to fish around in there, the search is not always intuitive so you have to figure out the right keyword to locate things. I found that a bit frustrating, it's not as easy to shop for apps on the windows 8 phone as it is on an android so I hope they fix this.So if you want a good entry smart phone that is cheap and can be used with the T-mobile wifi calling feature (which is awesome by the way) this is a good phone to get. Just be aware this is not an iphone or a galaxy and it is not an android OS so it seems that there are just some things you'll have to learn to do without.I also have an android tablet pc so I do not really need to do everything that the tablet can do anyway, the screen on the phone is small so surfing the web is difficult as it needs to be zoomed in to click links. Most of the websites offer a mobile version but you have to pray they also support the microsoft windows 8 phones.Over all I am happy and really the wifi calling feature is what sold me on this phone on top of the pricing.
-	I'm very disappointed... The seal on the phone box was broken... That tells me someone sent it back because of problems or whatever the case... then you (amazon) sent to to me!!!!  It works as a phone but wont got onto the internet through my data plan. Most likely will be returning the smart phone. Ill call Blu support first thing in the morning then decide....
-	The charger for the device broke after only five weeks.  I contacted Nokia customer service.  They wanted me to send the charger back to Texas for evaluation.  The problem is this type of device needs to be charged almost daily.  I asked Nokia to send me a replacement charger so that I can use while they work on the old one. I was told this type of charger was out of stock and they had to fix the old one and then give it back to me.  I was told that they did not have any local service stores for the charger and the only service center was in Texas.  I bought the device from Nokia store at Amazon.com and offered to provide the order number.  I was told Nokia does not use that information and I need to provide other form of proof of purchase.  I was told to provide detailed information about the purchase and myself and package the charger properly before sending to protect it from damage.  Considering the charger is properly worth no more than a few dollars, the time, money and effort to fix the charger is just too much.  Nokia is disappointing.
+	I Haven't activated this phone yet but I owned the very same oneand continue to use it on a daily basis because of the mp3 player.I quite sure I will be satisfied with this purchase, out of all the phonesI've owned/had with Verizon this was my absolute favorite. I would andhave recommended this phone to many people, & have also suggested to Verizonthat they bring it back onto the market. I look forward to the day when I amable to have it connected. Overall, yes pleased with this purchase. Very happy that Ifound it on Amazon.
+	WELL WHEN THIS PHONE CAME IN IT, LOOKED UNUSED AND NEW. I REALLY LOVED IT, IT HAD NO SCRATCHES OR ANYTHING G
+	my husband never wanted a smart phone but adores it. He learned everything about it with very little help. What a great buy
-	Well first when you record a video you can't he it. It makes like a buzzing sound. But for all the rest it is pretty good
+	I was surprised that I like this phone. I was scared of using it because I am always an android user. I definitely recommend this to people who are just starting out using smartphones or for the people that have budgets. This phone is cheap and also T-Mobile is very flexible when it comes to their plan. I am on a budget when it comes to phone because I definitely does not want to spend so much for just a phone that I only use for texting and calling. I don't use internet because I feel like it is useless if I could just go home and use my internet at home and I don't have any job that involves checking email 24/7. As a college student, this phone fits everything I need for a low price.Pros:-Easy to use-The weight is just about right-It look stylish (in my opinion that is)-Long battery life (I don't use my phone that often, only if I have to meet someone or emergency)-It feels durable-Wifi is a plus-Scrolling down and up the screen is really fastThere are a lot of pros about this phone that I think why this phone is the best. Try it and you shall know what I am talking about. :)Cons:Of course I have to put some cons that I find about this phone (or it is just me being picky)-Phone slides of my hand. (I suggest to buy a cover, I am 5'3 female weight: 115 lbs. I don't know if this information is relevant but I might as well say it)-When I first used it, battery heated up really quickly (I turned off every apps that I don't need like location, feedback, bluetooth, etc. so now it does not heat up anymore.)Since I found using this phone really easy, I bought my 59 year old dad one too. He definitely like it and it is his first smartphone. He is still trying to learn it after all he only has been using it for a day. I will update this review later on if he learn the phone already and ask him of what he thinks of the phone.I definitely recommend this for everyone.I will update this review later on, after all I've only been using the phone for a week. This is just my first impression of it.
+	This phone is the best value for money right now, period.Having the capability to download offline maps means I dont need to buy a GPS, which basically pays for the cost of this phone. You also get regular updates to maps for free for life (Nokia owns Navteq).Also, you can upgrade Here Maps App(for $15..its free for premium Lumia's ) and download offline maps for any country, so basically you have a gps with up-to-date maps of the entire world for $15 ( Priceless)Wifi calling is a huge plus, while travelling internationally.The much talked about app gap is closing everyday with a new official app for Windows Phone.
-	They sent me a broken phone that wouldn't turn on. I did get my money back a month later. Don't do it!
+	I can go on and on with a big list of pros and cons, but honestly, buying this Lumia 521 is a simple decision. Let me save you the trouble reading countless reviews. These are the four big points you would need to know.1) If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone. I went from Blackberry to Android to iOS. If you value apps, get an Android or iOS.2) If having a good camera is important to you, do not get this phone. With no flash, 5 megapixels, and subpar picture quality you will not be happy if taking picture is important to you.3) If price is a factor, then this is a no brainer. You will NOT be able to find another smartphone with the amount of features for $100 (less or more depending on where you buy it). Mid range smartphones start around $250 if you go the android route and you will find nothing in the $100 range to compare to this phone.4) Offline GPS and free music streaming. This is extremely important to people who don't want a data plan. You can use the GPS (it downloads the map to your phone) without a data connection and you can also stream free music at no charge (wifi or data plan needed).That's basically it after these 4 points, this smartphone can do pretty much anything the higher end phones can do for $100.
-	I ordered this iPhone 4 refurbished. It was supposed to be like brand new. When I got it the sensor light didn't work and every time you put it in speaker turning a phone call the person on the other line can't hear you. Bad quality. You can't make videos because you can't hear anything when you play back. Highly disappointed with product and service. The phone was cheap and to high priced for a pos that didn't work.
-	we bought this for our daughter because you could put a parental guide on it. NO YOU CANT. if you google online, several people cannnot figure out how to download apps. Micrsoft has no idea what they are doing. Also, when you follow all their instructions, they take you in loops. they don't help you at all.and of course, no one online knows how to fix it either. we all have the same issue.Don't buy. save your money and your insanity. We spent three hours or more following microsofts instructions....and finally, I'm  getting rid of the phone and buying an android.good lord!!!!
-	I just got this phone.  I think I may have dropped it once from my pocket to the floor and the screen is all screwed up already.
-	Phone is very simple to use, however if you are transferring your data from smart phone to Windows phone it is very complicated.  I took the Phone to T-Mobil Corporate store and they were unable to transfer the data. Even they at the Corporate store gave this phone bad reviews.  I end up returning the phone and bought Android phone.
+	It s a great ittle phone for it's price. It has all thea features you can have for a semi-smart phone.
+	Really like the phone. Provides all the necessities of email and browsing for a small price. Love the screen quality as well. Not the highest quality, but it does the job.
-	First of all the Pharos 600 is manufactured with a major flaw that when it does break the motherboard will be useless. The power plug/usb connector in the phone is made with a gap, space, void area that allows preassure on the soldered connection to the motherboard inside. At any time, the slightest preassure will break the soldered connection with forseen leverage on the usb connector. This is not the case with every other phone on the market. Other manufacturers do not have this planned designed defect.Then you have to deal with the company that will acknowlege the defect, unconcerned of the effect on the customer. You will have to pay for basicly another phone or walk away with your broken one.If less stars than one was available it would have been my pick ... for customer service at Pharos headquarters.
-	Many functions on the phone do not work. I do not have any access to the internet, I cannot download any apps. The phone is just used to call and text. I am thinking the seller sent me a refurbished one. Be careful.
+	love the phone! It is my first smart phone, great photo's and all the little perks. Just have a hard time typing. But other wise GREAT!
+	Bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself. We both love this phone. It is easy to use with lot of nice features.
-	The phone arrived on time, even earlier than expected. It contained all the accessories, everything was ok until... I saw the battery space empty... opened the device... surprise! No battery!!! Well, now my phone is useless until I get a new battery. I am crossing my fingers, hoping that my phone actually starts once I get the battery. Not sure who took the battery out, but it sure did rain on my parade.
+	This is my first Windows phone and I'm very happy. Read lots of reviews and compared options and I'm pleased with my choice. I use Family Mobile through walmart and there was no option to move the data from my old phone with a standard sim to this phone with a micro sim but Nokia tech support told me how to do it myself with my PC and a cheap card reader from Radio Shack. Really impressive, fast, intuitive and slick working phone. The external buttons, especially the camera button, are just right. Hit the ground running with this phone which makes it a snap.
-	I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100 unlocked international phone on August 2, 2013 from TechGiant and fulfilled by AMAZON.Today, October 17, 2013, it has stopped working. When I power up my phone, it displays the banner screen ('Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100') repeatedly forever. When I removed the battery and put it back into the phone. The same thing happens again.I contacted Samsung USA and they told me that they will not support the phone because it was made in the UK and they gave me the SAMSUNG UK telephone number. When I contacted Samsung UK, they told me that from the IMEI number that the phone was made in South Africa. I asked them to give me the SAMSUNG South Africa telephone number and they told me that they did not know the telephone number.So my phone is now a piece of trash.This phone worked less than three months. While it worked, it was great and has very nice features. But it was not worth spending $500.00 for a phone that only worked for less than three months.
+	It's a steal basically. The functions are pretty great considering the price. The Windows 8 system is speedy and easy to use, although the lack of popular apps such as Candy Crush and no flash player available is sort of disappointing. (But that's the OS system and not the phone.) I absolutely love the fact that I just had to cut up my SIM card from my old flippy phone, and the phone still works perfectly. Kind of wish the volume for 1/30 was a bit fainter, but it's all right.
+	For fifty bucks, it's worth it. I have t-mobile paygo gold plan which I keep alive annually with a $10 payment. I don't make many cell calls, and this plan doesn't allow data. However the sim card activates the phone and I think Nokia maps (download the entire globe onto an SD card for free) and direction apps like Waze make the purchase worthwhile. I like the interface, but windows OS is more restrictive than android, which in turn limits its flexibility. The music player is worse than itunes. I recommend the moliplayer app.
-	Update: Don't buy this phone, it has to many BUGS, and ZERO support...with no support planned. Kind of a shame too, as it has SOOOOO much potential, if someone would just take the time to iron out the software bugs. Gets to about 47% power...and shuts down, and WILL NOT RESTART until you plug it in. Periodically, in this "forced power down" it wipes out what ever you have saved on the "desktop". When the thing is running, it runs good...but, as said, to many glitches, and ZERO support. I really want my money back; should have just got the Nexus 4 in the first place.I have had this phone for a few months now. Long enough for the "NEW SHINY" fascination to wear off.In all honesty, its a mixed bag. I purchased this phone because of the 5band 3g ability. To be able to use T-Mobile system in their service areas, and still have 3g capability overseas, or in Alaska as well. (T-Mobile has a unique set of frequencies for their 3G service.)LOVE, the processor and speed...haven't found anything it lags on.Like a lot, the screen. The display is crisp, and clear; however, it is angle sensitive when viewed in landscape mode, like for watching movies.Call quality seems to be good, although,the reception seems to get "weird" anytime its below an indicated 50% battery. I have run this with no power control apps, and with power saver apps...it doesn't seem to make a difference. I am guessing that it is going into a internal power saving mode...but, it is inconsistent in this.Packaged headphones where actually a nice surprise. Don't expect top of the line, but your most likely wont need to run out and get something to replace them the same day either....The GPS system works good, seems pretty accurate, but is very slow to acquire a lock. Once it gets the lock, all is good however.For those techno geeks out there...its a good platform to play with, as it has developer friendly options, and is rooted already.Little things that a bit annoying, but easily remedied: Keyboard does not have a built in dictionary/spell checker. Download one from Google Play.The brightness on of the screen, in my opinion, does not have enough range.This does appear to be a pretty TOUGH phone. It goes with me everywhere, and, I admit, I have dropped it a few times. The back cover does not pop off, and no major scratches or bangs seem to show up.My other gripe, and this is probably do to BLU being a new, pretty much unknown company so far: The technical support seems to be lacking. They seem to be so busy rolling out new products, that they forget some of the slightly older ones. They dont seem to know if they are going to do an update to JellyBean (Android 4.1+)Last thing, the Camera, takes decent pictures, although, not great...and the built in software zoom, is not up to the job, so I would recommend trying a different camera app.Update: After some back and forth with BLU customer service, I am going to DOWNGRADE to 3 Star rating. This is primarily based on when I asked them about updates, and accessories for the the phone, I got the politician shuffle. I was told that they have no plans to update, or make available an update to 4.1+ Jellybean, as it would detract from the experience (???). And when asked about accessories, "As far as accessories go, we are currently working on acquiring a reseller for cases, screen protectors, and other accessories." Really, this phone is coming up on a year in the market now...and still no accessories. As someone else noted, this phone is AKA K-Touch v9.As for the memory, and storage issue, they did address this...although, this procedure is not shown in ANY of the literature I received, nor on their website (WORTHLESS). TO make the installed SD card the primary storage area, do this...Menu> Settings> Storage> Storage Location> Select Storage Location> Select "External Storage Card"> Switch To External Card.I would recommend doing this FIRST, before installing any new apps or whatever.Again, the Phone itself seems just fine, just dont expect any kind a support for it, like you get from the big makers.
+	This is a really great phone for the price.  I like how customizable the icons are for easy app access, but due to this layout you are not able to have a background photo, which was not a problem for me because I like the easy access tiles better.  Phone seems to be very fast, no lag time.  I wish it had a better camera with a flash, but for the price you cant beat this.
+	I bout 3of these, and all three love this phone.  It is amazing how I ask myself now, why it took so long to switch to a windows phone.
+	This has got to be the best phone around for the price.  I've had it for about 6 months and have been extremely happy with it.  It's fast, the display is clear, the camera is surprisingly good (5mp, no flash).  The WiFi calling feature is fabulous: my house is in a poor reception area but WiFi calling fixes that.  Also got to drop my data plan another $10 since almost everything goes over WiFi.  After using my WiFi on a trip to Canada my nephew sold his iPhone 5 and bought a Nokia 925 (said he would have gotten a 521 but didn't want to copy me).  I also had an iPhone before the 521 and was a little worried about switching to Windows Phone 8.  For me the experience is so much better than my iPhone, more responsive, better WiFi calling, 40GB of memory with an inexpensive micro SD card, live tiles.  BTW, everyone used my phone when in Canada to call home to the US.  They all had to put their expensive phones with expensive plans in their packs (turned off).  I wasn't charged a penny by T-Mobile for the hours of WiFi usage.  One petty complaint: wish there were more colors than just white. Yes, I'd recommend this phone.
+	This phone is fantastic. I am still trying to figure out how to operate its awesomeness. This phone is so high tech. It has Microsoft Word, its own music library and tons of other exciting things. I just found out how to screen shot now I just wish it had a front camera so I can video chat on my phone.
-	This review is on the Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile) phone.  I would give the phone itself 4 stars and the T-mobile service that it is connected to negative 5 stars.  I totally regret having bought a T-mobile phone.  Their customer service is the worst I have ever seen, and in this day and age that says a lot. I have had nothing but hassles and frustration from T-mobile.  They keep turning my phone service off, at the worst possible times, for no good reason, and with no warning.  Getting them to turn the service back on is a nightmare.  What makes it worse is that they do not appear to have any intention to try to resolve the problems with their service.  They seem to be quite content with making their customers go through hassles and frustration every single month just to keep a phone line going.  I have made literally dozens of calls trying to find someone at T-mobile who would help me, with no success at all.  There does not appear to be a way to avoid or to fix the problems with T-mobile's service. As much as I dislike the (apparently unfixable) problems with T-mobile's service, I hate T-mobile's attitude about it even more.  If you like to be aggravated on a continuous basis, then I would recommend buying a T-mobile phone like this one.
+	I work for T-Mobile- I bought this phone for me due to its low price and lack of customer issues. I use for my 2nd line ( my first line is a Note II ) This is a great phone- The only issues I have had is with apps downloaded from the Marketplace ( caused my phone to reboot ) The call quality and stability of the phone is great- With all Smartphones they will work best all around with a quick power off and on at least every other day.. ( something customers are weary to do not sure why ) Otherwise there are very little issues with this phone ( no MMS on wifi calling is one of the known issues customers call in for )Very nice smartphone for the price- If you don't care about having the variety of apps like Android and Apple its a great phone!
-	the phone i bought was not like it is advertised. they say its in a good condition but i found a lot of scratches. they say the phone is unlocked but it was not. i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
+	Having owned iPhones, Android phones, and Blackberry phones, this is a very pleasant surprise. This is so much better than the cheap Android phones running Gingerbread that are all over the place. For the average person who is just getting a smart phone, the Lumia 521 is a very clean, easy to use device that offers an unbelievable degree of functions for under $100 contract free!The build quality is also much better than the average entry level Android phone, and offers a similar easy, responsive user experience as an iPhone.There are better/more powerful smart phones out there. None of them can be found for under $100 without a 2 year contract. Great for young people on a budget, non-techie types getting their first smart phone, or a person who doesn't feel they have to impress people with flashy phones.
-	the phone doesnt work the way it was supposed to.... the camara doesnt work, the language settings on the phone doesnt include Spanish .... I bought it for my niece and she doesnt speak speak English. The seller didnt give me an answer
+	I was replacing a TMobile (HTC) G2.  This Nokia 521,  as far as I'm concerned,  is a better phone.  Literally,  I like everything on it.  You  can't beat the price!!
-	Rating is 0 stars.  Was sent wrong version of phone, not the advertised version; it was in compatible with my Carrier's frequencies and would only do 2g.  Replacement phone, although marked 4g is only HSDPA+, which is not 4g.  Mfg. Says claiming HSDPA+ is 4g is acceptable in the industry, to explain away why their amazon ad lists the phone as 3g but calling their office, their reps claim 4g., and they changed their packaging of the phone to read 4g instead of 3g apparently without making any increase in speed of the phone.  Consistently on hold for 40 plus minutes when calling Blu tech support while an irritating hold message played incessantly with only a 2 second pause.  Got emails from Blu that completely ignored questions I sent to them.  Blu could not tell me why there is a different keypad for dialing than the one that appears when you're in-call, and only told me that this phone is incapable of reflowing text properly when using pinch and zoom apparently after they googled this answer.  Unless on WiFi the phone defaults to showing non HD video and still take s 1.5 minutes or more to load a video at this poor quality.  I initially was able to download picture s from text but that has completely stopped working.  I felt the 5.5 screen was too large for comfortable one hand use but when I called Blu about buying the 5.3, which was just recently introduced, I was told they won't be making any updates for it.  I'm pretty certain they told me that none of their phones is faster than HSDPA+.
-	Very disappointed with this phone! The seller stated this phone was in "good working condition", but when I received it, the power button was jammed down in the phone. I contacted the seller and he stated that he still considered this "good working condition". What a joke!! I paid $116.00 for a piece of crap!!!!! I will never ever purchase from this seller or recommend him to anyone!!
+	For the price, you won't find a better phone. It's packed with features. One of the best is that it seems to have a real wifi router that allows sharing and networking between up to 8 clients. The router hands out inside IP addresses and creates a wireless LAN of its own. The phone audio is superior, the speakerphone works very well, it has an FM radio that works great.  To copy files to or from it you just plug it into the computer via a USB cable and it looks like any other USB file system. There is NO computer software (e.g. itunes) required.  It will charge from any USB port or a charger.  Management of multiple email accounts is trivially easy as each one becomes just its own square on the desktop.That said, I'm going to tell you all the things it will NOT do that I would wish it could, knowing everyone else will tell you what it WILL do.It is simply not as reliable and stable as my Blackberry 9700.  The 521 uses Windows 8 phone and while it is feature rich, apps or system features frequently quit or crash unexpectedly, and some phone features such as wifi calling will spontaneously lock out. All of these problems have ultimately been solvable by turning off the phone and restarting it or pulling the battery.  If I were Microsoft, I would aim to improve robustness and reliability ahead of features, but unfortunately that's not what sells.As another reviewer observed, the screen DOES attract and hold grime and slime seemingly more easily than other such devices.  This can be fixed by applying Rainx.  Remember, put the Rainx on an applicator or cloth first and the touch that to the phone.  Never apply a liquid directly.  I did this and the screen stays much cleaner, is easier to clean, and even feels smoother.No sync from Outlook via USB cable. I've tried everything including third party software and nothing works.No retry for failed messages.  It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.  My Blackberry 9700 would retry many times, typically succeeding in the most marginal of conditions, where one was in and out of coverage or in a very weak area.  This phone tries ONCE and that's it.  A major flaw since I had come to depend on automatic retries for messaging because I am often in marginal coverage.There is no customization of sounds except the ring for the phone, and that is size limited.  You cannot have custom sounds for other alerts such as text or email messages.There is no program for sending SMS using a PC program or a keyboard. Note, I have not tried to pair the phone with a bluetooth keyboard but that might work.There is NO user-facing camera for "selfies."The shutter release is delayed - you have to press the shutter button 1-3 seconds ahead of when you plan to have the picture taken.There is no USB tethering - only wifi as mentioned above, and that works very well.Stopping the music from playing requires you to pause the player indefinately or use an app named "stop the music."It has only buttons for volume (up and down), on/off, and camera.  I wish there were dedicated phone call and end buttons.It has no ability to detect holstering or unholstering.  Unlike a Blackberry, which comes alive when it gets drawn from its holster, the 521 requires you to press the ON button before you can do anything, unless you leave it screen ON and unlocked, which causes the screen to stay on and draw much more power while holstered.While it includes a calendar and contact manager (the people hub) which syncs with Microsoft's cloud, it has no "todo" list feature.  You can get DejaOffice for contacts, calendars, tasks, and memos and sync with Outlook.Smart phones have gone from being phones with some smarts to computers that are small and include a phone function. I had been using a Blackberry 9700 which I still like, and it clearly was the former. The 521 with W8P clearly is the latter.  While I still CAN go back to the Blackberry, many of the 521's features such as the built in wifi router for tethering and ease of managing multiple email accounts are very compelling.For the price, you could consider it a learning experience, even if after trying it you ended up giving the thing away.  If you did not use it as a phone, it will still work as a wifi connected tablet, which is not necessarily true of other similar products.
-	I had fun owning it for a few months, and I am glad Amazon took it back both times, with no questions asked. The Blu customer service was unable to address my issues in any way, and ended up requesting me to return the phone to the vendor. It was great to see that the return was painless after all those months, and now I have a different phone. Major problems: running out of space with GPS on, inconsistent GPS signal. Another issue was that Blu is not transparent that it is a cheap Chinese phone of some generic brand, with Blue having no resources to address issues with the phone. Blu seems to be more interested in branding more and more phones as their own than fixing problems or updating existing phones. Which is sad, because phones are not like potatoes- you cannot dump bags of them on customers and forget about resolving software issues.
-	Bought 2 of these. Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going. Had to return them.
+	This phone is truly amazing, durable, the phone system is perfect. Bought it for college and work. And it has been taking a lot of usage. Still working perfectly.
-	The keyboard has a malfunction just after 4 months of light use. I press "answer" key and nothing happens. Useless and not a worth purchase.
+	I brought this product for my mother for her birthday.. She loves it so I love it.. its user friendly and easy to use
+	WP has come a long way and this is in my opinion the BEST entry phone you can get. Nokia has delivered the goods yet again...
+	For less than 100 dollars, this is a great phone. Does everything I need it to do.Mind it is NOT an iphone, that's why it's cheaper. It's a start-level smartphone. Let's not compare it to top-notch models.Good battery life, good reception with T-mobile, better than other brands. I only do basic apps, so I don't really mind if the windows phone shop has less variety. Basic camera but good performance in low light. Attention: no flash, no front camera. You can download an autoshoot app and there you have it. It is also nice that you can tap anywhere on the screen to take a picture.The Here Nokia apps are very good: maps, driving, and pubic transport. I am impressed with them, I love them. The phone comes with Office, which is handy. The calendar app does not have a weekly view, which is kind of annoying, but a minor glitch. Calendar syncs perfectly with Google calendar, so I like it very much.The voice feature is cool. You can say "text Joanna", and then dictate your message and send it. You can also do voice searches. It is not Siri or anything, but it works well.The first one they sent was not working well, but I went on the Amazon chat and they gave me the best service ever, shipped me a new phone. You don't have to deal with the seller since the phone ships via Amazon, they take responsibility, no risks!I am very happy with the phone and I recommend it.
+	Love the phone. Major upgrade from my HTC MyTouch 4G. BUT... TMobile still sucks almost everywhere I go. But this phone helps make that more bearable. Why am I still with them anyway?
-	No one could understand me so I called my home phone and left a message...  it sounded like I was underwater with a rag stuck in my mouth.  Complete crap.
+	This Phone is excellent . I love that you can upload songs and play it offline. It is also light and apps are easy to learn..
-	Sellers discription says the fone is a blu studio 5.0 530 but its a blu studio 5.0 520 n the 520 is a dual sim where I was lookin for a single sim which is the 530
+	Hello people,I have been shopping on Amazon for a LONG time (12+ years?), and if I remember correctly this is the first time that I have written a review of a product. That speaks volumes, doesn't it? Yes, I am THAT pleased with this phone that I decided to write a review.I bought this phone from HSN for $84.75 for my son (actually he bought it with his own saved up money but I ordered it online) a few weeks ago. It was on a $99.95 special and you got $20 off for being a new customer. Add $4.80 tax and the phone comes to about $85. It was free shipping so I was already happy. I did have my doubts because:a) it was a Windows phone, andb) it was a Windows phone, andc) well, it was a Windows phone, andd) people had complained about the lack of apps available in the Store for the phoneand lastly, what kind of quality phone can one get for under $100 these days, correct?However, I figured that since the phone had a 30 day return policy (HSN included a pre-paid, self-addressed UPS label in the shipped box) why not try it? If my son didn't like it, I'll send it back. Well, it only took a few hours for my son to become the biggest fan of the phone. He was speaking so highly of it that I had to check it out again, this time in much more detail than I initially did when I received the phone in the mail. Wow! What a great deal we got! It is definitely a quality phone and quite possibly the BEST PHONE AROUND for the price--please do not compare it to its sibling, the Lumia 925 also from T-Mobile which is over $500.00--and therefore highly recommended.If you are with T-Mobile, or are thinking about it, I would definitely recommend this phone. Unfortunately, HSN was sold out of this phone as of this morning, but the current price on Amazon ($100.00) is quite good, especially with Amazon Prime's free/two-day shipping.So, my son really liked it, and so did I. I already have two Android phones so certainly am in no need of buying a phone for myself, but it was time to upgrade my wife's old Android phone, which had become quite unreliable with frequent freeze-ups and other miscellaneous issues. Guess which phone I got her? You got it! She really likes it too. It makes integrating with one's Hotmail (Outlook), Outlook Calendar, SkyDrive, and sync'ing with Windows 8 quite easy, seamless, and enjoyable. Despite what many people have said, the selection of apps in the Store is not so bad, and it's growing by the day. Now, the options for free GAMES apps are not as huge as Google's Play Store but it's on its way. If the primary reason for you buying this phone is free games, you may want to wait a few more months as the Store becomes stronger in its games apps offerings.So far I have spoken highly of this phone but in all fairness, I must mention the two things that I did not like in this phone:1) The Back, Home, Search button/keys are NOT backlit so until you learn their position in your hand while holding the phone, it can be quite annoying when you are trying to accomplish a task.2) There is no flash on this phone, so if you take a lot of photos at night or in a dark environment, this phone may not be right for you. We have a Canon Rebel T3i as our primary camera, so a phone camera has NEVER been a selling point for my wife or me, but it's always a nice option to have a decent camera on the phone. Nonetheless, it is a secondary thing for us, but I know a lot of people who use their phones as their primary cameras...so just something to keep in mind.Lastly, both of the boxes that I ordered from HSN came with the phone, a charger, a (very short) USB cable, a charger, and a micro SIM card. I just called T-Mobile and activated the new micro SIM since my wife's old phone took regular SIM, and it took all of 4-5 minutes to have her new phone up and running.Well, I hope that this review will help the potential customer(s) decide whether they want to buy this phone or not. As for me, I am ready to buy a third (or more) Lumia 521 whenever the need arises.
-	My husband has always wanted one of these phones and he recently broke his so I ordered it for him. I overdrew our account to do it so i actually payed more than it costed to get it, but our son is a special needs child and he needs a phone for emergencies, when we got the phone we were very happy with it, until I found out we can't use it! Sprint doesn't support these anymore and I can't put any other sim in it to work because its not a GSM phone! I'm very unhappy and can't believe I wasted money on this, this shouldn't even be available I buy!
-	Phone is very heavy and I cannot access the internet on this phone. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
-	I'm a windows user and I'm really a shame of this phone. It never  connect to the network, It gets hot all the time, I got all my call dropped even though I get all the bars on my status bar. The camera doesn't even have a flash. it really sucks!
-	I averaged one freeze per day on this phone.  I then exchanged it for the same model, and the one I exchanged it for was worse.  I returned that one as well.  I would advise if you see any odd behavior, I would exchange it immediately before your first 14 days is up.
+	Never had a windows phone but it was pretty easy to adjust to. The price is incredible for this phone, absolutely incredible and now they lowered it even more?! Of course as soon as I buy it they drop it $20 grr... But at any rate this is an awesome phone, lot of stuff to keep you occupied. Highly recommend this
-	Didnt like quality of fone seems like cheapy I think the picture makes it look kool but u get it n the phone suxz
-	Treated gently but stopped working.  Battery does not charge.  tried a different cable and still no charge.  Even when it did work, it was super slow and I bought it because it had a 5mp camera - but camera pics were not very good either.  Unfortunate, but don't waste your money on this product.
-	Unlocked phone distributed by Wireless Everything was from a foreign source and on a "lost or stolen" list, per Consumer Cellular. Instructions were in French (I'm In Reno). Power adapter didn't work. Samsung does not support international phones, which are unlocked but don't conform to U.S. specs. Had a problem with notification ring, couldn't get help. Will return it.
+	I use my phone mostly as a PHONE, however this Nokia phone with Windows and Camera is outstanding. Apps are easy to use and download and navigation is easier than Android especially when I got to used to it. Where I stay we have a weak T-Mobile signal and it is compensated with Wi-Fi home signal. And it will provide my laptop with Wi-Fi share; my old Android couldn't figure out.
-	i just got this  phone a few days ago and i have to say this phone is a piece of crap and the blue tooth on this phone keeps cutting on and off by its self cant get 3g or 4g  and i didn't know the seller sold me the D610I which is the international phone and i would  want to give this 0 stars and my sounds keep  going out also it charges funny and it slow as heck and no notifications lightsDO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!
+	If you are looking for a good smart phone and not wanting to spend 600 dollars then this is the perfect phone.
+	I am not a tech savvy individual and do not see any reason to spend the money on the other high tech more expensive phones if it is not necessary.  This phone allows me to text,  access the internet, review my emails, take photos and videos of decent quality and even make phone calls (I know, right?).  I also purchased this phone for my wife and she has fallen in love with it as well.  It isn't a top of the line product but it serves each of us just fine with out compromising our frugal ways.
+	i got this phone from HSN.com on the day it was released for 149.99. now i think it i available for 130 at HSN or walmart. i am a hard core smart phone user and i have used all OS from all brands. i got this phone because my galaxy nexus got stolen and i needed a phone right away i couldn't find a phone that was worth the money at that time. This phone was cheap, non-contract and i got to try new things: wp 8.so, for android users who look into deep customization, don't come to this phone. wp 8 is not designed for that.for hard core smart phone users who run all kinds of weird or tough jobs on their phones just because "i can", give this one up. This one had limited ram and does not have NFC and the tethering function was messed up (by T-mobile). Many beautiful 3D apps cannot be run on this phone including the famous game temple run. and one big fail is that wp 8 does not allow installing apps on microSD...and 8gb runs out very fast for a hard core user. it is definitely not enough..at all!for beginner smart phone user, this is an amazing smart phone! it is extremely smooth (i've got to say, my nexus freezes/lags all the time). it has built-in office (much better the office apps on other platforms); it has autofcus camera which performs amazingly with very decent quality; it also has an enough resolution for the screen: very clear and bright. it is basically fully functional as a smart phone in spite of all the bad reviews about wp8 and the lack of apps in the store. The stock map app, music app (similar to spotify) and camera apps are useful and fun.basically, wp 8 is a closed system like IOS but allows at least a little more customization compared to IOS. you can change the theme color; you can arrange the tiles in the way you like and with certain apps, you can make a wallpaper with the tiles which are also functional as buttons.to sum it up, for hard core android users, it will take some get used to if you swtich to wp8 but for iphone users, you may find this phone pretty and more fun (IOS7 is coming out and it is supposed to be amazing...so i dont recommend switching at this time hehe...).This phone is the best smart phone that you can get at this price range.
+	This is one of my firsts shopes at Amazon, and in Internet; however everything worked great.The phone also works great.The delivery was as said. Overall, I'm satisfied.
+	Had some issues setting up internet when I transferred sims on tmobile, still trying to work it out after a couple calls to t-mobile customer care. Other than that, phone usabilty is great.
-	I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note II last November from a reputable online retailer here in the US. Last week, not even ten months after the original purchase, the phone stopped working.When I try to power up my phone, it displays the banner screen ('Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100'), but then it stops there. It never leaves the banner screen, it never dims, it's just stuck there.I've tried removing/replacing the battery, SIM card, and flash RAM card, I've tried (unsuccessfully) to get into Recovery Mode, all of these with and without the phone plugged into the charger. Nothing I try works.I contacted Samsung USA, only to be told that Samsung USA will not support the phone because it originated in the UK. When I contacted Samsung UK, they informed me that they will not support their devices when used outside their country, and advised that I contact Samsung USA or my retailer. Of course, the retailer won't help me - they didn't manufacture the product.For $645, I purchased a nice phone that served me well. Through no fault of my own, it has inexplicably died, and Samsung will not even discuss the problem with me.As you can imagine, I am extremely disappointed in Samsung. While their products are arguably the best in the Android world, their interest in their customers - and repeat business - seems to be very limited. I have never witnessed such blatant neglect of responsibility for a product this new, costing this much.Why would I ever want to buy another Samsung product - much less recommend Samsung products to those I know - if this is how they treat their customers?I own a Samsung monitor and a Samsung TV. I sure hope they last longer than my phone. Because of my experience with this phone, I have little faith in Samsung standing behind any of their products.My advice to everyone is to AVOID Samsung products. This company is not worthy of your trust.
-	I spent $300 on this phone in Turkey (cell phones are very pricey there), because I read these great reviews. After a mere month, it stopped charging. One night it was charging and the next... I wake up and it's not.Also, the customer service is a pathetic waste of time. You have to answer a bunch of questions and wait forever for them to get back to you. They advised me to contact their sister company (since it's the sister company that sells overseas), and I had stated the reason why I was contacting them was I wasn't getting a response from their sister company. Each time we emailed, they had the same response: "You need to contact General Mobile."General Mobile's support webpage doesn't work. When you submit a complaint or problem, you get an error message.Coincidence? Highly doubtful. Don't waste your time with this stupid company. Now I have a $300 phone that has only worked for 1 month. I loved the phone, but, umm... I can't use it if it won't charge.
+	Wonderful beginner Windows 8 Phone, easy to use, and room for plenty of applications. Great price,great idea for today;s college student.
+	Well just received this phone,I was replacing a huawei? summit,and let me tell you for 70$ you get probably 2-300$ worth/feel of a phone easily!If you're reading this review and up in the air about choosing between phones,just choose this one you can't lose.only downside is no google play :(
-	device performs much below expectations. The only reason i keep using this phone is because of the larger screen I need which no other phone in the US can offer. Aside from that there is not much to admire about. Instead recurrent problems include,Rotate screen frequently does not work which can be very annoying at times when it is most useful (i.e. during gps driving, the screen failed to rotate many times, which forced me to rotate the car mounter instead).The two window feature also confusing and sometimes does not seem to work.It s got pen but I dont use it anyways.Video and still pics taken by care automatically uploads to google+ without any warning and by default which is a security concern for me. So far I havent found a way to disable it, the setting does not offer to disable this. Not sure if there is a trick around if I research it online. In either case, it sucks that they did not make this effortless.
-	I give him a star because I had problem with the telephone on having bought it they it sent without free hands or original loader the telephone parecia that was re-promoted despues communicates with the seller me respondio with responsibility and rapides every execpto re-put the manual that appears in the photo me sending a manual of rapid guide and the telephone has not even 6 months that I it change and already on the part where it connects to load appearing problems to load for one month apparently this one as mop the connector of load of the telephone to be a new telephone not deberia this fault and the battery to present me salio bad I had to buy other one
+	I am a rare case and have been using Windows Phone since version 6.  I never buy the latest and greatest but only needed a smart phone to send/receive email so I always waited until I could get a phone that was over 1year old for super cheap.  I never use GPS, because I know how to read maps and can generally get around a city without them.  Flash forward to the release of Windows Phone 8 and I'm stuck on 7.5 and never felt the need to upgrade.  My wife was sick of Android and iOS and the inflated bill that came with it on Sprint.  She is also not a power user, but like everyone else in the US, are brainwashed that they need $700 phones to survive.  Well her contract finally ran out and I got her to convert to prepaid and bought this phone at launch.  The OS allowed her to explore more apps and is more intuitive in layout and design then the others.  Battery life was a godsend as she can use it all day without it dying by 3-4pm.  I found myself playing around with it more and more and couldn't see myself not getting one(Thanks MS for not supporting WP7.5), so I waiting for an $80 sale and bought it. Long story short this is a phone that truly is budget conscious without cutting design/build quality.  You simply can't go wrong with Nokia and WP8.  Takes great pics on full sun/daylight only.
-	I purchased this phone and when it arrived discovered that it had a chinese programming... imagine trying to do the setup... pretty much clicked on every simbol/word until something would happen like it was going to be setup for language. Then found out that the screen is also defective... does not react to touch, I had to enter the password like 20 times for it to recognze the movement... it freezes every time I access an app... phone feature freezes... on your end... on the receiver's end they can asnwer and get only the blank sound of someone leaving you alone in the conversation and then when you manage to unlock the password again, the call is still going on... not good for your minutes :-( and finally when I contacted them, they would simply say that could not have it reprogrammed or repaired cause it would void the warranty... then when I asked if I could ship back but they would have to make an excepcion since I am sending it back from overseas I got no response back at all... simply did not respond anymore. 1 star is still too much in my books, not only I lost the money, I don't have a phone and can not even sell it. Stay away from this vendor.
-	I do not even reach the phone, I made the purchase on May 30 and has not yet reached, until it reaches me I will qualify with no good score
-	1. Purchased  my Note II cellphone on Nov 19, 2012. Received it barely more than a month, it wouldn't detect the SIM card anymore, and sometimes shut down by itself. Of course there is no accident to the phone, and just normal use. My phone company replaced a SIM card, and it still wouldn't work.2. Contacted with the seller, SurgeTelecom through Amazon on Jan 13, 2013 and they wouldn't allow to return or replace it, since it is more than a month from shipping, though the Amazon holiday return ends on Jan 31, 2013.3. Called Samsung US support, they told me this is a UK model. Samsung US will not support the cellphone, and told me to ask Samsung UK for help. It is not easy to get help from UK, since I am in US.4. Issued a claim to Amazon for selling the UK model without noticing in the description on Jan 16, 2013. Asked to replace the cellphone with a US model or get full refund. 4 days passed, and no reply from Amazon yet.I will update the progress.5. After 5 days, Amazon replied: "you did not contact the seller within 14 days of receipt to report the issue or return the item within 30 days of shipment."6. Contacted Samsung UK, I need to send the broken phone from US to their UK service site for checking. I need to pay the shipping fee.7. Shipped the phone to the UK service center on Jan. 28 and arrived Great Britain on Feb. 7 with the Express Mail International information: "Payment of charges - Item being held, addressee being notified." It seems the phone still didn't reach the UK service center.8. Called the UK service center, they asked me to call the post office to see why the item didn't deliver. Called the UK post office but couldn't go through. Sent an email request to the post office, no reply got.9. March 11, 2013 EMS tracking "Unclaimed - Item returned to sender". I may have to keep the broken phone.10. March 23, 2013 the phone was returned. The reason on the parcel box is that the Customs/Postal charges didn't pay. The total charge is £69.97 (VAT £56.47 and Parcel force handling fee £13.50). The UK service center didn't pick up or didn't want to pick up the phone to repair due to the Customs/Postal charges.11. Sent to a private repairing site in CA.
-	No quibbling or politics.  Yes this is a pretty phone.  Camera is decent and it is large like the other more expensive brands. That is where the similarity dies.This phone is an under-capable phone because it does not possess the internal storage needed to install enough apps to justify the size and specs for the rest of the phone.  It is so huge, and has the dual core memory, but a teeny internal storage issue.  After FB, email, and Pandora the phone is acting lethargic and the email stops working because it mismanages App storage.So if you plan on never installing another app, or using the phone to check email, go ahead and give it a shot.But, if you  plan on a couple apps (games, forget it, no internal memory space for that), look elsewhere.  This phone allows for a max of 500MB of internal storage (apps, not pics).  The OS takes about 350MB, so once you install a few other apps, you are within the "Warning Range" at which apps stop functioning to preserve phone function.PS - there is apparently a way to root the phone and get it to use the whole 2GB of space which would fix the issue.  If anyone has detailed procedures for this, I would volunteer to try it out and report back.
-	The key board will hardly respond to command.......had to return it......was not very pleased with it but its OK not
-	Just bought the phone.  It appears to bo ok.  The big problem is that Pantech released the phone before the interface software was finished.  There is no way to interface this phone with a computer.  Older Pantech software doesn't work and generic Windows dirvers can't recognize the phone.  Support doesn't know when it is ever going to be available.  I would put a hold on purchasing this model until they have the product complete.
+	are you Looking for a change? Go for a lumia..Its worth the price and good smart phone at entry level.
-	Very disappointed with this item. I've owned the same model phone previously and loved it.  This phone was purchased as a replacement. doesn't make or receive phone calls on a regular basis. Well be contacting seller to resolve...hopefully
-	I purchased $100 worth of T-Mobile prepaid refill card.  When I attempted to redeem, I was told it's invalid.  I reported the problems to T-mobile customer representative and supervisor by calling 877-778-2106.  I provided the purchase receipt, order number, amount paid, and all other information requested.  After lengthy conversations with the representatives, they noted that my order is verified and it is in their records.  However, they were unwilling to issue replacement cards or refund.  Reason provided for not crediting the prepaid refill cards was that it was more than 90 days old, and their policy is that the cards expired.  Hawaii law prohibits Gift card/prepaid cards with expiration less than 5 years.  Filed complaint with statte Attorney General's Office.
+	I bought this to upgrade from my Lumia 710 on T-Mo since all the newer apps are only coming to WP8. The phone itself is a nice size, a little bigger than what I had before, but not overly big like the more popular phones - it also has a solid build to it but still feels nice and light in your hands. It comes preloaded with many NOKIA exclusive apps, which help make the WP OS pretty awesome in my opinion - I'm much more likely to buy a NOKIA WP than a HTC now because of the exclusive apps. The 5MP Camera is good, supposedly it will be getting NOKIA's PUREVIEW technology to make the camera better via a software update, but it's more than enough for what I use it for. Speakerphone is good, works well for when I use it. Screen is responsive as are the side buttons which feel solid. I was lucky enough to nab one of these from big W for $130, which makes it even more of a great deal. $130 for a quality smartphone OFF-CONTRACT is awesome, which is why I almost saw no reason not to upgrade from my 710.Just a few little CONS:I'm not wild about the white backing, I would really like the ability to buy a cyan or yellow back plate, but the Lumia 520 shells apparently don't fit the Lumia 521. Hopefully Nokia will eventually start selling them.While the screen is larger (4") than what I had before on my Lumia 710 (3.7"), it isn't very sharp, almost the same if not worse quality than what I previously had. It's not terrible, just not nearly as nice as the newer phones.Even though it's more of a budget phone, I still wish it had Corning's Gorilla Glass - otherwise it feels really strong.No front camera - this isn't a huge issue for me, but I'll probably be using skype a lot more now and it would be nice. Not a deal breaker, but it would be nice.Overall the phone is great, my cons are just little nit-picky things that obviously didn't deter me away from buying it and I'm still very satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.UPDATE 6/29/13Still enjoying the phone, however it is randomly resetting itself, which can be a little frustrating at times. It's not that often, but most phones don't have this problem.
-	I thought it was a pretty cool watch till I noticed the band broke up by the speaker. it don't do anything it should like you set a ring tone, it plays the factory set ring tone so why have that feature. well I would not recommend this watch to my worst enemy sorry but I would like a refund and they can have it back......
+	The phone itself is nice I have no complaints with that. but since I have had it, it has alarmed and had blinking lights and only chinese writing on the screen so I couldnt fix it, i could only take the battery out to get it to stop, and it has done it twice.
+	This is such an amazing smart-phone for a great price! I love that you can choose to set up the phone without allowing data usage if you don't want it to use 4G data! The screen smudges pretty easily, but that can be fixed with a screen protector. My only problem, was that the battery was loose, so the phone would power off frequently when the battery wiggled a little. That was easily solved with a folded up sheet of paper put into the battery clot to hold everything in tighter! This is such a great phone and I would recommend to anyone! anything bad you've heard you can throw out the door!
-	I never received my phone I ordered my phone on DEC.12th and I still have not gotten my phone...I emailed this company and they never answered back and its been almost 2 months now..it was a Christmas gift so much for that so I don't know what to think l would just like to know where's my phone or where's my money????
-	This Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100 - factory unlocked- will not work on either Cincinnati Bell wireless or on Verizon Wireless.
+	We need a good phone to contact our relatives on various planets. I think this one will do us just fine. Nice to be able to get a few apps, too.  Great price, although I see the price keeps going up and down.
-	First off, let me say that I'm a windows fan.  Xbox, PC, but this phone has to be the most piece of garbage I've ever had.Phone is just a piece of junk, internet explorer turns black sometimes so u have to constantly re load the page to see it.  Your music is replicated over 6 times on your memory card for no stupid reason, and there is no fix for it. Microsoft acts is they never heard of the problem  before even though its wide spread.  Your Mobile account app to look at your account does not want to let u log in, so u have to call in customer support every time to change your pass word.  What a nightmare  of a phone.  Don't waste your time, total garbage, wish I stayed with iPhone, way too many issues with windows system.
-	I got this Samsung Galaxy note 2 in a seal broken box. Was highly disappointed with fact that phone was gray colored but the accessories were white.Clearly we got a opened piece and this is first time where I felt let down by Amazon.
-	I GOT MINE IN A TINY SMALL PACKAGE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE BEEN THROWN ALL OVER SO I GOT MINE WITH CRACKED ON FRONT SCREEN DUE OF LACK OF PACKAGING. SO MAD!!!! THEN I USED IT FOR TWO HOURS AND IT FREEZES ALREADY. VERY DEFECTIVE. DO NOT WASTE UR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS. NOT WORTH IT. DISSAPOINTED CUSTOMER.
+	She is a first time smart phone user, and I think windows phone is easier to pick up than android or ios.  She seems to be handling it just fine!  I like the big screen so that the buttons are bigger.  The only drawback is the lack of a camera flash, that I can see.  But it seems to take decent pictures, and the price is right!
+	Wow, I am blown away about the quality of this phone. Im going to give you a full scale review because I know what good phones consist of in comparison with the price. First, let me say that I've had every phone out there with every type of market.1. Phone size- screen is a nice size. 4 inch in length, and 2 1/2 in length.2. Battery life- Great, will last a day in a half if you have it running full time.3. Functionality- This phone flows amazingly well for the price. Moving the screen to apps to music to pictures is a charm.4. MY OWN NOTE: Wow, when it comes to watching youtube, netflix, and the t-mobile channel...wow amazing. There is no buffing what so ever. This is a very big deal. If I can watch live T.v on my phone with no buffering then thats amazing.(So the speed of the phone is amazing).5.Only down fall is no flash, but its 70$!! This phone is the best bang for the buck on the marker right now.6. Apps work well, and down load in 5 seconds which is amazing.
+	This is my first mobile phone. I needed one only for emergency contact. Of the models T-Mobile uses this was the cheapest smart phone. The many reviews on the Internet converge. Good performer, lightweight, reliable, good battery, modest storage, mediocre camera with no flash. Despite its Windows hobbling it is a terrific value. I bought mine refurbished (slight yellow discoloration of the display) for $35.
+	I got this phone for my mother, she previously was using a WP7 phone and was limited to the applications on it. Now Since she has this one which is a WP8 she pretty much has accessibility to all the big applications like on the other smartphones. It also comes with a really great turn-by-turn navigation application plus the 4g is really fast.The only bad thing I don't like about this phone is the feel of it being too lite and feels like it's extremely easy to break. Also powering on the phone takes a while as well to get to the main screen.Other than that the phone is fast and has a really smooth running interface. Highly recommend this phone especially for starting up.
+	This is a great phone under $100. I can surf the internet and check email. Camera is wonderful. I get all features like $400 smartphone. One thing I don't like is T-mobile.
-	I purchased two phones. One is great, the other drains within a couple of hours and has to constantly be charged.  We have changed the batteries out, turned everything off and it is definitely the phone itself.  Be very careful purchasing this phone.  We discovered this right after the return period and not we have no recourse with the phone.  We are stuck with a defective phone.
+	This phone was a replacement to a Nexus and serves its purpose very well. The phone performs basic internet functions with ease and is really good value for money
+	This is one of the best phones. It has many features as a smartphone but in my opinion it's better than a smartphone.
-	I can't wait to receive my phone, the price is a steal I'm hoping the phone is the same. Ill change to 5***** when I receive it.
+	So far, this phone has worked very well for me. I hope that it continues to operate this way, Very satisfied !
-	I regret ever waisting my money. I should've known better. Buying a phone for $80 what do you expect. Ugh!!!
+	The call quality is so great.  I almost think it is impossible to get this clear phone call on t mobile network.  Overall, a phone is about call clarity and battery life.  Nokia is great for these!  The screen is very responsive to touch.  That is great.There are certain features that it is lack, but I am keeping the phone to make clear phone calls.  It is not too big, so I can hold it in my hands when I exercise.  It fit into my lifestyle.Note, I do have a big tablet for more sophiscated task. I don't really use it more than a phone.
+	It's difficult to find a cheap phone that doesn't feel cheap.  I bought this phone for my son since he's on a pre-paid phone plan.  We weren't about to spend a few hundred dollars on a phone for him.  This phone looks and feels like a phone at least twice the price, and his friends are impressed by it too.  I'd definitely recommend it and I'd buy it again (hopefully not because he broke his though!).
+	I got this as a mother's day gift for my mom. She was using an old unlocked iPhone 2G running whited00r with no data plan. This phone was like a huge breath of fresh air for her. Didn't take me long to get her acquainted with Windows Phone as it's a very user friendly mobile OS. She's now Facebook messaging and texting/calling relatives overseas with Viber like a pro. Since I got this phone as a mother's day gift (gave my dad an old Lumia 710 running WP 7.8 I had laying around so he wouldn't feel left out), I changed my family's T-mobile plan to include data on all lines; $100 for 4 numbers with unlimited talk, text, and web. My parents are blown away by now being able to browse the internet when they're not at their house, haha.
+	I recently ordered this prepaid phone due to me dropping my last phone and cracking the screen. This was a "cheap" backup in my mind, for I did not want to spend a lot of money on a phone for I am no high tech phone gal! (I still had a QWERTY). The phone came and I converted my SIM card and it has been great ever since. This is my first all touch screen phone, so navigation to me wasn't rocket science, but this phone makes it easy to adjust. I recommend this phone as more than just a "cheap" backup, it's actually a great phone period for anyone looking for a bang for their buck and a new aged smartphone if they aren't a fan of the IPhone.
-	Update.  If you cant handle hyperbole, then i recommend leaving the internet now before yu get any further.  This phone is absolute junk, and my issues have no rectification.This phone, without a single doubt, is the most infuriating, unreliable horror show you could possibly invest in.  I have been using this phone since July 2013, and honestly this review would likely devolve into a foaming rant.  Instead, lets just place a series of bullet points here.-camera is unwieldy.  The delay between pressing the button and the actual taking of the image can regularly be 5 or more seconds.  Grainy resolution and no flash, its a major step backwards even from the cheapest smartphone.-it ignores all settings regarding wifi vs. Cell connectivity, so be prepared to use up all your data, even fom home.  An example of this is if you mvoe from one wifi to another, it requires turning off and restarting wifi connectivity to reconnect with your initial wifi connection.  To do this, you must enter three menu screens.-complete and utter lack of customization.  This is windows 8 in all its glory, you get to pick from a limited palette, and that is it.  Everything else is the wonky square pattern UI that is the opposite of useful. And you are etuck with the god awful stock keyboard that prevents easy txt editing.-no apps.  I know the windows store is adding more apps, but the quality is lacking in every regard.  Investing in Windows 8 mobile is like investing in LaserDiscs in 2013.  There are few functional apps, so if you rely on google docs, you're in for some frustration.-voice recognition for dialing is unresponsive and unreliable.  Maybe one in ten attempts can recognize I'm even saying a name.-my phone contact list was imported directly alongside my entire facebook list, without my input.  So to call anyone, I have to slog through my ENTIRE fb list to find them.  This sort of prethinking "we know better than you" stuff is rampant with this phone.-what apps they do have are barely functional.  Go ahead.  Try using the ebay app, or netflix without wanting to throw this thing across the room.  The unifying visual themes are forced throughout each and every app, which means the dysfunction of windows 8 can now be had in every endeavor.-the unlock button goes off on its own in the pocket, and on multiple occasions I heard a voice only to realize I had inadvertently dialed a random person ffom my fb list while it was in my front pocket.-the volume button requires a restart of the media to take effect, so if a video starts, and its at max volume, youll have to stop it and restart it to change the volume.-the headphone jack doesnt always cut out the speaker.  So if I put my headppones into it, its literally a crapshoot whether or not everyone else will hear the song.I was going to have a pro/con list, but after mjuch thought, here is my list of pros for this phone:-it didn't give me AIDS.
-	Sellers discription says the fone is a blu studio 5.0 530 but its a blu studio 5.0 520 n the 520 is a dual sim where I was lookin for a single sim which is the 530
-	The Samsung Galaxy Note II is the perfect example of an over-engineered product. The user interface is way too sensitive -- I have to change back my settings on a daily basis because the interface changes just about every time I use my phone. It takes a beautiful picture, yes. The interface is nice and big for searching the internet, yes. But to make a phone call? Even when I'm extremely careful about not pushing buttons (putting my hands only on the outside rim and not on any buttons) my ear/face touches the screen and voila, I'm somehow changing my clock settings to Saudi Arabia time zone, or removing my Favorite Contacts, or turning off my Bluetooth setting. In summary, it is a terrible phone. Secondly, I find that the operating system does buggy things -- like if I change a setting, it may change back and when I go in and try to update the setting, it shows that the setting is different than it actually is. Rebooting helps, but that's so old-school Windows to have to do that all the time. My suggestion is that if you're only going to use it for its non-phone features, you'll be OK. But for me, I really regret paying so much money for this -- wish I had gone with the iPhone.
-	Purchased a refurbished iPhone4 8GB Verizon for my daughter who had broken her previous one. I purchased this item, specifically, through Amazon fulfillment to eliminate any drama if problems were encountered.IT WAS NOT PROFESSIONALLY REFURBISHED AS OUTLINED IN AMAZON'S STANDARDS AND PRACTICES, NOR MINE.Upon arrival, first indication, the phone was packaged poorly, the iPhone was free-floating within its box. I inspected the metal casing and the photo optic sensor. The metal casing showed serious signs of wear and abuse, especially the right front corner, adjacent to the optical sensor and flash on the opposite side. The photo sensor was out of alignment with the lens. I didn't even bother to examine front and back glass.RETURNED.Given the reviews in this string, outlining intentional disinformation, dealing with lost and/or stolen iPhones which cannot be activated, etc, I'm very surprised Amazon allows this vendor to continue to abuse their clientele.I would not deal with this firm as you run the risk of being ripped off, subjected to verbal abuse, as described by other buyers.
+	Arrived quickly and the phone is efficient! Only down fall you will have is the lack of apps. For an entry level smartphone it is quick and does what it can
-	I am not a cell phone expert so I didn't really know what to expect. Product details say 4 gigs, when I got it it only says 2 gigs. To make matters worse it doesn't even use it, instead it only uses the 512 megs of ram it has. Right away I got "Out of memory" errors and the phone automatically uninstalls apps. So I got a 16 gig micro SD card, didn't help a bit. Moved as many apps as I could to the SD card, but many Google apps don't give you that option.Really pissed about being lied to about the memory.The camera on this is beyond terrible. Think a cheap digital camera from the 1990's quality.So in conclusion unless you only plan on send some txts or making calls it should fine. Consider it an overpriced flip phone, because it is worthless for running apps.
-	Wow, wasn't I surprised to receive this great looking phone for my son for Christmas only to discover it's a lost/stolen item that I cannot activate.
+	For a reliable phone that cost less than a hundred, it cannot be beat,  a good phone for a great price
+	I love the features but still trying to learn how to use the apps. Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it. I love that I can have access to my documents and pictures that are on my computer. Recommended for those who  are apps savvy
-	I was in a jam - I needed to port away from Sprint due to their horrible coverage, but I could not afford another Galaxy S series phone. So I purchased this phone using Straight Talk. Verizon Wireless coverage is good in my area, so it should have been a win/win situation... I just needed to adjust to an entry phone. I can do that, as the extra functions I used my higher-end phone for where more as a substitute for a tablet anyway.But there are some shortcomings worth mentioning that will matter to many people. One is the lack of a LED to indicate a missed call / message. Yes there appear to be LEDs there - but nobody is home. The NoLED app fixes this. The camera is basic, but dang - what do you/I expect. The sound quality of the music player is poor when using decent headphones, a non-issue for many, a breaker for others (I've tried different players - the problem is the electronics of the phone). However taking the positives into account (Android 4.xx, decent screen, good voice recognition, great battery life for an Android phone) I can deal with that.BUT what I can't deal with is the terrible reliability. Between friends and family, I have been involved in the purchase of 3 of these phones. One had a microphone failure within a day, and it's replacement failed 2 weeks later with another problem (was replaced with another model). Mine has become very erratic and shows gibberish on the lock screen, and I am facing a cumbersome replacement process. Only 1 of the 4 phones are still working correctly... as far as I know. Now we aren't talking about kids here - but adults over the age of 50 who take care of things.This is not a good reliability track record so far. Such a good phone for the price - but if it can't be trusted to work, is it a bargain or not?UPDATE: PLEASE READ - Samsung does not service/exchange this phone under warranty, you must contact Straight Talk for warranty service. Straight Talk is impossible. During my call to them, I was asked "Does the phone make and receive calls?" (Yes) "Does the phone make and receive text messages?" (Yes) "Does the phone receive data?" (Yes)... "Then the phone is working... is there anything else I can help you with?"Amazing, simply amazing. I understand that the carrier is often the provider for product warranty - but the carrier does not stand behind the warranty that they are under obligation to fulfill. I've had good luck with Samsung products, and view the problems with this model of phone as an exception. But Straight Talk is turning out to be even more of a problem here.
+	I just order this cellphone but it absolutely looks beautiful and very thin. I do not receive it to activate. its supports a lots of features. when I read the features in this cellphone it's incredible but it's real. I believe it should be able to work in most cellphone company providers. This is the reason why I purchase this smartphone cellphone without doubt.Stand by for more comments when I activate this cellphone.....Best
+	This phone does not have some of the bells and whistles that more expensive phones have, but it works exceptionally well and is great for most users and at a very reasonable price.
-	Piece of crap didn't work out of box. If you are looking for a cheap cell phone, that works, go to walmart, or target they have $50 phones to $100 smart phones better than ordering online. Cause then you order the cheap case and screen protectors that arent worth returning and you are effed with those... Do yourself a favor and dont order a cell phone from Amazon
-	I so wanted to love Windows Phone. I have always rooted for the underdog. I loved my Mac back in the 90's when nobody loved Mac. I even used WebOS long after Palm/HP had given it up. But my God! Seriously, Microsoft? You have years to try out the iPhone and the Android iterations and THIS is the best replica you can come up with???In summary, Windows Phone remains the phone OS of those with @aol.com email addresses, the elderly, and those who miss Snake Game on their Nokia 3310.Okay, let's get to the pros and cons...PROS* It can both make and receive phone calls -  Yup, it works as a phone. Once you get to the phone section. Oh, and don't forget to turn off the wifi calling, since that makes you sound like you are talking on a 1999 Motorola MicroTAC. Submerged. Roaming.* Battery life is good for two solid days -  Though this may be because I stopped using my phone when it stopped informing me of... anything.* It looks just like a bar of soap -  Made me feel cleaner.CONS* No option for a background picture – I know it's stupid, but I like seeing my family.* Giant, space-hogging tiles that don't do anything – The email tile shows ONE unread email. No matter how big or small you make it. The weather tile uses its space to let me know it's getting info from the Weather Channel. The CALENDAR tile only shows one appointment too!* Voice recognition recognizes whatever you say – after it beeps at you, even in silent mode. And if you tell it to punctuate, it writes that. Where Android or iPhone would write I am going to the store, then home. Do you want to meet me there? Windows Phone writes I am going to the store comma then home period do you want to meet me there question mark. Yes. Windows phone puts a period at the end of everything. Whether it needs it, or some other form of punctuation, or none at all.* Voice recognition is a prude – want to swear? Too bad. Want to talk about (for example), my customer Mr. Aswalla? Nope – He's Mr. **#*$*# Walter now. That's exact, by the way... I'm not censoring. Windows is.* Apps? Nope – Yah, you can Yelp (if you can get to it). But you sure can't do much of anything else. Oh, and most mobile webpages don't show well.* Vibration sucks – in an Android phone, you know by the pattern of the vibe exactly what just happened. On the Lumia, it's more of an awkward death rattle for everything.And my absolute favorite? Ready for this?* NO STATUS LED! - That's right... If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh. I keep clicking refresh on the tracking info, waiting for my Moto G to arrive.
-	I Returned this celphone twice. The first time I ordered with Techno.Trading.House and I got the phone with different 3G Network Band. I received the one with 3G Network HSDPA 850 / 2100 and Amazon specifies that the 3G Network HSDPA is 850/1900. I need the 1900 band because this is the one that my carrier uses for 3G Network. The second time I ordered with Phone Etc and I still got the phone with different 3G Network Band. This time I received the one with 3G Network HSDPA 900 / 2100 and Amazon specifies that the 3G Network HSDPA is 850/1900. I need the 1900 band because this is the one that my carrier uses for 3G Network. I returned for second time and placed a new order. Amazon customer service told me that this time I will get the phone as They specifies, I mean 3G band network 850/1900. This time was again with Techno.Trading.House and Surprise !!! Still got the phone with different 3G Network Band. This time I received the one with 3G Network HSDPA 850 / 2100 (same first time) and Amazon specifies that the 3G Network HSDPA is 850/1900. This one I have not returned it yet.
+	Amazing phone battery good screen perfect size not too big so far so good we got it 2 month ago and it dosent show any proplem just insert the sim card and you could transfare your number as soo as you have a microsoft account its free .
-	This is a scam. An absolute joke. Not only does it not get reception, drop calls, and not download videos because the wifi compatibility is so poor, it also shuts off on its own, has very little battery life, and everything is in Chinese!! Hands down the absolute worst phone I have ever had in my life. I should have read more reviews. Don't let the few good reviews trick you, it is terrible.
+	This is a very simple smartphone. It does not have a front facing camera or Candy Crush, but it gets the job done as far as calling and texting goes. I bought this as a gift for my father and he likes it, however, the lack of a front facing camera has caused him to look for a new one. Despite that, for the price and the overall usefulness of the phone, I would recommend this product. If you just want a nice looking phone to make calls or you know somebody that wants a simple smartphone, this is the one to get.
+	Great phone. Easy to use. Lots of color. Not too big. Very user friendly. My daughter loves it more than anything
-	This is my second blu product I've had to return because of issues.  At first I was so happy to find a decent specced phone with a long, I mean long lasting battery! All was well until I tried to use the navigation. As soon as I needed to know where I was going it would take forever to find my location or it wouldn't find me at all! If it did manage to find me, it would put me on the first side road and bounce me all over the place! Even uninstalling google maps updates didn't help :-(This will probably b my last crack at blu products. ..
-	Using this phone on Straight Talk for $45.00 a month unlimited everything. What a great buy. Was considering the N7105 but it was just way to pricey. Very happy with this phone and the new stylus is AWESOME with the new button capability for added features. Split screening apps and Youtube video "overlay" on your existing screen is great.UPDATE: PHONE CAME DEFECTIVE. As a mobile electronics tech for a repair dept specializing in Android-based devices, I diagnosed this device as a faulty ROM chip on the mainboard. I have spent the last MONTH trying to return this device to the seller and have since filed an A-Z claim through Amazon (they have been MOST helpful) and the seller has been EXTREMELY difficult to deal with. Within the first 2 days they told me to simply contact Samsung about my defective device. At first I just wanted to exchange it for the same item, now I just want to get as far away from WorldWide Distributors as financially possible. BUYER BEWARE !!! Great phone but buy from different seller in case you receive a lemon like I did.
+	I have had iPhones, multiple Android devices and some experience with other Windows phones.  I can honestly say this borders on being almost a GREAT value. especially if you want a GSM phone that let's you drop the contract and switch between the GSM carriers.  This is labeled T-Mobile phone (our current carrier) but pretty sure it will work most other GSM networks too (YMMV).The Windows UI is perfect for my wife.  She texts, reads some emails, uses the navigation, takes some pictures and makes phone calls.  This phone performs all of these tasks more than adequately.  Now if you need the absolute latest and greatest, skip this phone.  We already have a dedicated camera and use tablets for a lot of our online time, so we don't need our phones to do everything these other devices do.  As a result, this "mid-range" device is a perfect addition to our family.Biggest Con?  The battery life.  But no worse than other "smart" devices and we have chargers all over our house and cars, so we can deal with it.As always, Amazon Prime takes the risk out of "buying and trying".  All in all, a truly great value from the best online retailer.
+	I bought the Nokia 521 about 4 weeks ago and it has been perfect. I used this one to replace a Nokia 710 which was my first windows phone. This phone is light years ahead of the 710 except for the camera, and only because the 521 doesn't have a flash. It is way more reliable than the 710 ever was. The blue-tooth is flawless and if you use Zune or X-Box pass you can pack a lot of music with a 64GB Micro SD card. This phone has everything you could want at a low low price. 4G speed and WiFi calling are topping on the cake.
-	Stay away!  Microphone sound quality is abysmal.  It cuts off treble (high frequencies) and leaves a muffled garbled sound that constantly gets a "what did you say" or "I didn't understand a word you said" response.  AT&T; obviously wants to sell smart phones so they can make money on a Data-plan and I don't think that it is too paranoid to think that they purposefully do not sell a decent flip phone. We chose to replace it with a RAZR from the internet. There must be a reason that you can still buy RAZR's.  At least Toyota supports the RAZR's Bluetooth but unfortunately GM recently stopped supporting RAZR's.
+	The Nokia Lumia 521 Phone was delivered timely and in great condition.  I bought this to replace an identical phone that my grand daughter had. She is very pleased with the phone.
+	When I was looking to replace my not-so-smart phone, I have to admit that no WP8 phone was on my list. I didn't think there would be any, as I was aiming at a sub-$150 budget without a contract. At that price level, I was pretty much looking at Android phones of various specifications, OS generations, and/or refurbished with dubious quality. Then I saw a local electronics store advertise this Nokia 521 for $120, and that prompted me to do some research. And then I was sold.- High on my list was a battery that would get me through the day. This one will do it.- Also, is the battery user replaceable? Yes. They don't last forever, so this is important.- Expandable storage? Yes.- Easy to use? From the reviews about WP8, I hoped it was ... and I was not let down. Very intuitive, I must say.Yes, there are some drawbacks, as others have noted, but none are so detrimental as to completely ruin the experience. Factor in the price, the pros absolutely overshadows the cons this phone has. Are there better smartphones out there? Sure. Are there better smartphones out there for under $150? None I can think of.FWIW, I'm using the phone with PTel (Platinum Tel), a MVNO operator on the T-Mobile network. There is no need to unlock the phone - the only change you have to make is the network. To do that, go to settings, access point (it's further down), and then enter the applicable entries as documented on PTel's site. Set it to active, and you'll be good to go.
+	I bought this for my girlfriend. She is not tech savvy, her last phone was a blackberry.  Aside from no front camera this is not a bad device. The cameras on these Nokia phones are nice, and despite the lack of applications for the platform Microsoft has made their ui very friendly. I personally own the surface 1 and beside being slow (compared to my nexus 5) it is pretty nice. I'm giving it to my mom for Christmas, haven't decided what tablet I will buy next.
+	I have had this phone since August 2013 and I fell in love with it. New apps are being added everyday and I do not regret my decision in buying a windows phone. I am currently updating to the lumia 810 because it has a front camera, but this phone was amazing! The only problem I had was the lack of front camera, which developed after a snapchat app was added to the store. This phone was a perfect first smartphone and I will keep it in case an other break. Don't let some of these reviews scare you, it was an amazing phone. It has amazing camera quality and is very easy to use.
+	love this phone not to big not to small! wish the screen was bigger like the nokia lumia 900 i really like the amoled screen on that phone.
+	With a lot of mixed reviews on this phone I will say this. I love this phone!. If you are used to android or iOS then You probably won't like this phone. The windows platform is different than any other and a little to get used to. But if you want a phone that can integrate everything you do, this phone is for You. Downsides are apps for a windows phone are limited, so if all the popular games and apps are important then maybe reconsider. This phone has Microsoft office and is great to sync with your windows PC for use of documents and graphs and things that you may need on the go. Battery life is probably best I've seen in a smart phone. Phone  is lightweight and very small in comparison to most smart phones. So if your a windows person or just need a entry level smart phone, don't let the price fool You. It is worth $70.
-	This review is related to the Nokia Lumia Windows phone as well as the service through T mobile. I purchased this phone from a T-Mobile store in April '13 and immediately noticed that the phone shuts off frequently while being charged. The phone will also shut off completely while in a rest or battery saving mode. The main problem with this is that while it's off you are not getting calls, and when it shuts off while charging things like the alarm cannot be relied on. I have been sent a replacement already, and I am assured that when my second replacement in 2 months arrives, it will also have the same issue. The most amazing (disappointing) thing is that they will still sell you this phone right now, even though they know the phone fails to work properly. T mobile however will take no responsibility for the phone they retail, and even had the nerve to refer me to Nokia. I did not purchase the phone from Nokia, I purchased it from T-Mobile, when my 3rd phone fails for the same reason I will be calling the state consumer board and my credit card company to dispute the charge. Clearly the phone fails to perform as promised and I cannot get the retailer (T-Mobile) to make the purchase right. I have been with T-Mobile for 11 years now and the best I can get from them to make this right is that they will give me a small credit for the phone I paid for 2 months ago, that is legitimately defective, and let me pay for a new one. I hate to see that after all these years T-Mobile has ditched their traditional customer focused service and gone to the usual, ignore the customer until we lose them way of thinking. I have to highly recommend against this phone if you are looking for reliability and cannot afford to have your phone shut off without notice. I also have to say that if you are considering T-Mobile based on reputation, they are not the customer service company they were a few years ago.
-	I was excited when i purchased this phone until it started to malfunction. The audio fades at times and the display turns off and can't get it to light up again for a couple of minutes.
+	I purchased this phone for my nephew and he was well pleased with it, enjoying every moment of it. will order again
+	I LOVE MY NEW WINDOWS NOKIA PHONE!! I CANT BELIEVE SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE, TALKING BAD ABOUT THE PHONE. I HAVEN'T HAD ONE PROBLEM WITH MY NEW PHONE. PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT DON'T HOLD A CHARGE, OR ABOUT THE WIFI WHEN THEY LEAVE OUT OF RANGE AND THEN COME BACK TO IT YOU HAVE TO RESTART YOUR  WHOLE PHONE. JUST STUFF LIKE THAT ARE RIDICULOUS!! EVERY TIME I LEAVE MY WIFI RANGE AND COME BACK IT AUTOMATICALLY PICKS IT UP AND EVEN KEEPS THE PASSWORD SO I DON'T HAVE TO REENTER THE PASSWORD. AWESOME PHONE!! I WILL ALWAYS STICK WITH A WINDOWS PHONE NO MORE ANDROID PHONES! WINDOWS CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!
+	I've had this phone for less than a week, but I'm getting a feel for the windows phone environment. On the Nokia side, the hardware and build is superb for the price. You wanna talk about plastic, grab a Samsung galaxy at $600. This phone is plastic but is beautiful.  I never use the front facing cameras so I don't miss it. The flash that is missing on the back can be made for, by adjusting the camera settings. I miss a lot of the apps from Android but they will come, give it a chance. This os is less than a year old.Update: not going back to Android anytime soon. The Windows Phone is has me impressed. I guess I grew up tired of my Androids lagging and freezing up all the time. I'm staying with this phone for at least a year. Most popular apps have ports via third-party developers on Windows Phone. Vine, twitter,tumblr, Facebook, reddit, every major app is there. I can't find good spreadsheet, vpn, PDF, programming apps though, but I'm a power user that buys cheap phones. Call me cheap, or smart buyer. But I'm willing to give all those apps up for this smooth phone. I still use my previous Android if I need to use those power apps, but this phone is my everyday workhorse. One major thing missing is that the browser can't save passwords. You need to use the Lastpass app to solve that. 4 stars
-	I hate it ! wouldn't want anyone to get this ! this phone is too slow, poor quality and the camera sucks really bad
+	Easy to use, simple design, lightweight, tons customization options, can do a lot if you own and use it with your PC. Highly recommend this product. Only complaint, freezes up occasionally if too much is open or you cycle through programs too quickly (though this happened before I did the software update and since then has not happened).
-	I use ver***n service and checked with them. They supported this model. However, when I brought my unlocked "German" phone into the service center. They couldn't set up my account because of software issues. The company delivered exactly what it said it would, they just didn't explain that unlocked don't mean squat.
-	First of all in the description it said that it was in perfect condition, the top button did not work!!!!
-	Be careful when you purchase this product. There is no warranty for this item. My phone broken after used for 6 months
+	I didn't buy this on Amazon but I did get a similar price where I bought it (big box store). I've had it for 24 hours but I've spent considerable time so I do feel I have things to report. I will add more as I have more experience with this smartphone. I'm waiting for the T-Mobile SIM card so there are a number of things I can't do, like make calls!My personal reference is the iPod Touch 5th gen I've had for a year so you'll see some comparisons in my review. It's all I have to compare because I've never owned a smart phone before.There's no question this is a pretty good phone for the money. It's a lot more phone than I expected. But it has it's Pros and Cons.Pros:- Memory: I don't know why it was so well hidden in articles, specs, and reviews but this phone has more than 7.2GB of storage. About 4.2GB is available to the user. This should be plenty for apps. I'm adding a 32GB microSD card to store music, photos, and videos. So no problem with storage.- Removable battery: I can't tell you what a relief it is to find phones that still have user replaceable batteries. I'm not concerned about daily use and having a backup battery. What I want is the ability to drop in a fresh battery after a year or two when the original battery is losing it's storage capacity. All batteries do slowly fail. I won't have to send the phone back to the factory and pay the price of the phone to have it replaced. I see batteries for this phone as low as $8 on-line.- Display: While the pixel count (800 x 480) is well below my iPod Touch 5th Gen the quality is so close I think the 521 may sometimes be better then the iPod. That surprises me because I think the iPod display is exceptional. The 521 display touch screen is also very easy to use as it is quite sensitive.- Performance. I feel the phone is pretty snappy. The only time it seemed slow was loading web pages. That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.- Size: As I've been using the 4" iPod Touch 5 for about a year using the 521 4" display seems quite natural. It would be nice to have a larger screen but not at the expense of weight. To me the main thing is that it feels comfortable in my shirt pocket, and it does. It is almost the same size in width and height as the iPod but a bit thicker. If being thicker allows for a removable battery then I'm all for thicker.- Camera: Okay for daylight but quite poor for indoor shots. No flash doesn't help either. The quality of the outdoor photos is acceptable for posting on-line like Facebook. There is no front camera but I've had a front camera for a couple of years and seldom used them so this is no big loss for me. I really like the dedicated camera button on the side.- Phone: I'll report back here when I get the SIM card and T-Mobile plan. I'm going for the #30/mo no contract with 100 voice and unlimited data and text.- WiFi Calling: This is a great feature that should allow us to make cell phone calls through our home WiFi. Unfortunately I've learned that this still burns plan minutes; how unfortunate. It will compensate if our local T-Mobile service is weak at our house. I'm very much looking forward to trying this out when we get our SIM card and plan. I'll report back here in a couple of days.- Power button: It's on the side. Not a big deal but it just seems more natural to me to be on the top. I'll get used to it.- Volume rocker: One nice feature is when you click on the rocker while audio is playing a set of controls pop up on the screen so you can forward/back/play/pause from there even if you are in a different app at the time. The volume shows a number from 0 to 30 in the upper left corner of the screen as you adjust the volume.- Charging: Imagine this. A standard USB connector on the bottom. Not a special cable like Apple. I just don't know why Apple can't just use a standard USB cable. I charged the phone yesterday and have spent perhaps 8 total hours playing with the phone, downloading apps, cruising the web, listing to music, etc. The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.- Snap off back: It's a little unnerving to bend the back to remove it but it does easily snap sharply back into place. I wonder if it will weaken and come off to easily over time. I like the feel of the back on my hand. No fingerprint magnet here. The surface provides a little grip with its slightly rough surface.- Feel of the 521: The Apple iPod Touch 5 is a quality device, thin, metal back, and light weight. But it costs $399 and isn't a phone! The slight extra weight and thickness of the Nokia 521 isn't bad at all, and it costs $100 and IS a phone.- Buttons below the screen on the front: I'm very happy that all three buttons are capacitive rather than mechanical. I've had problems with the mechanical Apple iPod Touch start button in the past. I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find. With devices such as the iPod the "back" feature is in the software and sometimes the back buttons are hidden or are placed in different locations on the screen.- Software: I'm a big fan of Microsoft and Windows Phone 8. I really like the idea of having Windows 8 on my desktop, my laptop, and my smartphone. The interface is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to figure out how to find things and customize the display. There are tons of apps and many good ones are free. Those that charge don't charge a lot of $. It is handy having "live" tiles that show things like the current stock market quotes, outside temperature, number of unread mail messages, and various other things.- GPS: I'm very impressed that you can download maps for free and use the GPS feature without even having a SIM card. I was able to select a destination and it will give me a course to follow using the HERE Maps app that came in the device. It isn't a Garmin. It doesn't auto correct if you take a slightly different course, but you can easily reset the trip and it will plot a new course. No voice directions. But still even if you spent the $100 to buy the device and just used it for a GPS it would be worth it.- FM Radio: Yes it has an FM Radio. I didn't know that until I was reading Help+Tips on the 521 and it was mentioned. I tried it out and it works. Too bad both AM and FM radio in Redding CA is not very exciting.Cons:- More than once I've set the Nokia Lumia 521 down on a table, not too hard but a little drop, and it shut off and rebooted. I don't know if it is just this particular phone. Hopefully other copies don't have this problem. In fact I'm returning this 521 today and getting another one because of this problem.- I've heard of others having problems with the phone dropping WiFi. This has happened to me just once.- Windows Phone 8, while adequate, is clearly behind in features. I understand an 8.1 release might have a notification capability such as can be found in both Android and iOS. No mistake though. Windows Phone 8 is fully capable.- Apps: There are many thousands of Windows Phone 8 applications, but still there are a few that I use regularly that are not available on Windows Phone 8. Alternatives are available but I haven't found any as good as the ones I've been using. This is true for just a few apps but they are critical for me.  First Downcast is an awesome podcast app, not available on Windows Phone 8  Second mSecure is the password keeper I've been using, not available on Windows 8  Third Toodledo to-do app, not available on Windows 8- Another thing I really miss in Windows Phone 8 is something like "folders" on iOS. I use them to group things together, much as Windows 8 on my PC can group things. Not available on Windows Phone 8.- No easy way to adjust screen brightness. If set to Automatic it doesn't work well for me. For example in a semi-dark room the automatic feature turns the brightness down so far I can't read the words on the screen. The alternative is Manual which only allows Low, Medium, or High brightness, no slider for much better control. The way to change brightness manually is buried in the Settings and takes several steps to get there. iOS 6 wasn't much better but Apple finally fixed that bug by introducing the Control Center in iOS 7.- Voice control: It works and I've used it a number of times. But it is no Siri or  Android's voice features (I understand the Android voice assist is much better than Apple's Siri). The voice control can be used to make phone calls, start apps, or vocalize texts.- Calendar. It works but it could use a lot of improvement. You get a month view that you can't zoom, and a day view which you can scroll through past or future dates. I was able to include my wife's calendar events and set them to pink while mine are in blue. I read a rumor that this app is being updated soon.For $100 this phone could be purchased instead of an iPod Touch. If you buy it, stick in a $25 32GB microSD card, and don't get a phone plan, you've got a cheap alternative.Given the price I do highly recommend this phone.We have been using only feature phones for about 15 years. I've never wanted to pay the high price for the data plan to own a smart phone. Truly what I wished for was to be able to use a smartphone on the Verizon network but only use WiFi for data and not pay for a data plan. Then I discovered the cheap T-Mobile service. I bought this 521 as an experiment to try out the T-Mobile service. If the T-Mobile plan work well the three members of my family that have phones will switch to this plan which means we will be paying the same monthly amount but now will have unlimited data and text too. If it works well I will likely buy a better phone, and as much as I want to use Windows Phone 8 I don't think it is ready for prime time. I will likely go with an Android phone.
-	I bought this phone for my mom on mother's day. We have Verizon and I read the description up and down yet still never saw anything stating that it's not Verizon compatible!! Long story short, phone did come on time, didn't work at all for Verizon because Verizon specifically makes their phones a certain way so that international versions will not work, returned it, and the "small fee" they said was to be taken upon return was about $100!!?!?! Ridiculous!!!! Never again...
+	Fantastic phone for $80 - bought this phone to evaluate T-Mobile in my area (we currently have 5 Verizon phones and are paying way too much each month .... so evaluating T-Mobile with the hope that coverage is adequate and then get significant monthly savings).The Nokia Lumia 521 is a perfectly adequate phone. My main phone is the iPhone 4S ... I was expecting the Lumia 521 to be much inferior to my iPhone, but honestly I think I'd be just about happy enough  to use the Nokia instead of my iPhone (which is really not what I was expecting). My actual plan is to have 4 Nokia 521's and one iPhone if I go the T-Mobile route - all paid for up-front... which upgrades the current 'dumb' phones being used by my family on Verizon and still nets a ~$100 per month savings.There are a few things to learn with the Windows 8 OS on this phone - but generally it's close enough to iOS (I'm using iOS7) that I quickly learned all the features. It seems less customizable than Android, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing (much of my family are a little tech-averse).Overall - I'd highly recommend this phone at this cost.
+	Item like The picture, fast deliver 3 days well packed, good Quality for the price .  phone is really lightweight and looks decent. Though I am not too happy about the white backside.The screen is sharp, bright, and colorful. This Nokia runs Windows that is really intuitive and easy to use even for a person (like me) who never had a smartphone before. The phone feels very fast and responsive. The menus look pretty. You can choose color and content of your home screen as well as size, color, and location of the icons. Also, I chosen Bing background (beautiful landscapes that update every day or two) for the lock-screen and like it a lot. WiFi works great. It connects to my home or work network instantaneously. So, the only time I use my cellular data is when I travel to/from work. The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.
-	Do not buy phones from these people I bought one and it was reported stolen from someone so just letting you all know.
-	slower then my T-moble "My Touch" phone. 2G network only. i use its with WIFI in my house, the WIFI broke off all the time. dont upgrade and apps from its shipping. the internal memory will be full and gave you error.. so, no addition apps can be download even with SD card. I think its software in the phone is bad design. the phone also clack in my pocket. If you look for a cheap phone, try to find something else.
-	First off the phone is white and it clearly says black! Also the back easily falls off! It's a piece of crap!
-	I have had this phone for less than 2 months and already the keyboard is malfuntioning.  I type M and Z comes up, P won't work at all.  I bought it for a test and it has proven that dual sim capability is possible but this thing is not worth the $50 I paid.  Go with a name brand and let the Chinese sell their junk to themselves.
-	There exists a market of people who buy a phone to be a phone, not a tiny portable computer with silly applications.  This phone is intended to meet that market.  It does not come with fancy applications, and its feature set is about as basic as they come.  Nevermind that pressing almost any button at any time will cause a sorry excuse for a web browser to launch, almost certainly incurring fees on any phone plan that does not include data.  Nevermind that its menu system is incredibly brain-damaged and fails to live up to the standard of barebones phones of even a few years ago.  OK, so the phone is intended to generate data revenue and has a shoddy feature set; that's *FINE* for those of us who just want a basic phone.The problem is that even as a basic phone this product fails miserably!  The audio quality can be so poor that conversation becomes almost impossible.  I'd love to use a nice wired handset to make up the difference, but in the unceasing war on standardized phone plugs, purchasing one that actually fits this phone is nearly impossible.Seriously.  If you're looking at this phone, go with something like a Go phone instead.  That way you'll at least feel better about not wasting your money on a loveless 2-year contract with a phone whose only redeeming quality will be the satisfying crunch it makes when it finally meets its end.
-	I throw it right in the garbage you can't take pictures everything it's slow not a good purchase do not buy it...
-	I was excited to get this phone for two of my sons.  I got two of them.  I spent hours setting one of them up.  When I went to set up the parental controls so that I could block some of the content he would be able to access on the internet I was unable to.  Apparently Windows has NO option to be able to do that at all.  Even my service provider Tmobile couldn't block ANYTHING, even with their blocking options set to child.  I called Nokia, Windows, and Microsoft.  It simply is not possible to block their access to the ENTIRE web!!!  I sent back both phones.  I can't understand why they would not make that an options for parents!  If this is what our world is coming to, where a company with so much technology, is unwilling to let parents protect their children from so much of the garbage that our society has to offer... God help us!
+	I have not read all the other reviews and I'm sure someone else used the same subject line, but this is a great phone at a great price! Although it is feature-limited, you still get a current Windows 8 phone with 4G speed (where available) and decent battery life. I also have a Nokia 820 and between the two the three main differences are: no flash on the 521, no audio equalizer and the materials are a little more plastic. But it is lighter than the 820 and with the $4 shell I bought, it's a sturdy device. If you want a professional camera on a phone, this isn't for you. If you want a smart phone for under $100 that will be dependable and fun to use, buy this phone.
+	I received my new phone promptly and in perfect condition. This is my first windows phone as is my first time ordering through amazon and am pleased with both. Very happy with the product so far and I highly recommend going through amazon as they have great prices.
+	This is a great smart phone considering how little it cost.  I purchased one for under seventy from the Microsoft store.  Windows phones have VERY limited apps when compared to Android or IOS, be aware of its limitations.  I find apps from Bing or Nokia to be of the best quality.  The Windows 8 phone interface looks nice and feels snappy.  I use the phone with the pre-paid T-mobile $100/year phone only plan and my WiFi connection at home.The free Nokia Map apps allows you to d/l maps (free) for offline use.  This means the phone can be used as a stand alone GPS device without a data connection.  You may need to d/l the Lumia Storage Check app to set the map location to your microSD card, since the USA map is around 2.9 gigs.  Else, you can d/l individual state/country maps at more reasonable sizes.  The free Nokia Music app also lets you d/l music mixes for offline use.The battery life, is typical of smartphones at around 1-2 days between charges.  The screen is a fingerprint and grease magnet.  It gets really greasy and nasty fast.  I recommend getting some sort of anti-finger print screen protector immediately.  The built in camera picture quality is not very good.You get a lot of phone for your money with the Nokia 521.  It is much better then any similarly priced Android smartphone.
+	At the time (about 6 months ago) I snagged this for a low $94.50 now its even lower at $90.00 if your tight on money this is a no brainier smartphone good battery life, ultra sensitive touch screen and just very good overall. Comes with one year manufacture warranty which i used last week for a battery problem (free shipping both ways)
-	The description is correct, but misleading.  This is an unlocked phone, and it is capable of 4G data speeds, but only on ATT.  With T-mobile, you get Edge speeds - at best.  Does not say that anywhere in the write up.
+	This is a really good device, well made, has a lot of nice feature especially at this price point. Windows Phone OS is slick IMO much better than iOS, but there is without question a lack of apps. If you can live with the apps available this phone is an incredible deal.Then there is the other option... not using it as a phone at all but a stand alone media device. Buy this phone and a $50 64gb microSD card and you have a full function 64gb media player for $50 less than a 32GB iPod, half the price of a 64gb iPod. Yes the phone works as a media device, GPS navigation works, wifi internet and streaming (Netflix), all without phone activation.Either way this is a bargain.For those not familiar with Windows Phone here is a real good very complete free user guidePaul Thurrott's Windows Phone 8...[...]
+	For the money, this is more than a good phone. I also like the fact that is a T-Mobile, prepay as you go phone.It has all the features you'll find on a high end phone with the only exception being a 'facing you camera'. It has so many features in fact, I have a difficult time remembering all the different functions. The phone get's on the internet very fast, almost no hesitation. It's stylish, elegant, just plain looks cool and with the windows 8 interface, you can rearrange or create new tiles for the start screen. I would recommend this phone to anyone, particularly those who do not want a long term contract or people who dislike AT&T.;
+	For the price, it's a great value and performs well.  It might not have all the trimmings of an iPhone or Android and few apps, but it does plenty for what I need and can't beat the price so I'm not locked into a long contract
-	I really like what this phone can do when I compare it to my iPhone 3gs, the widgets on it are extremely useful. The biggest problem I've hand with this phone though is that it's response time is slow. Apps will crash constantly, audio files will takes as long as 10 seconds after you hit the pause button to stop playing. This was an extremely annoying part of my phone before I realized what was going on (now it's just annoying) I would hit the pause button over and over thinking maybe I missed it or it didn't register, finally it would turn off and I'd think I was good slipping it into my pocket. I'd walk a ways (as long as 30 seconds later) and all of the sudden the audio would go off again.ProsPhone size is perfectWidgets are usefulCustomization is very user friendly once understoodConsPhones processor is to slow for the phoneCan't run all apps from the market, you'll want to research specific apps if you are considering purchasing themAlarm snooze seems to be every single button on the phone
-	I have had this phone for a month already, and I can say that I am still discovering new features I didn't know it had... Even after watching tutorial videos I still find new things.Iphone 5? You can't compare that to the Note 2. It would be like comparing a BMW 335i to a Bentley Continental Supersports.If you are looking for a phone, get this one.Update 07/10/2013Unfortunately my phone suffers of the SDS (sudden death syndrome) and it freezes and crashes like 5-6 times every day... this is getting very frustrating since I spent almost $700 on this phone just 8 months ago. I never rooted or did anything you are not supposed to do with this phone. I made some research about this problem and it appears like lots of other Note IIs and Samsung Galaxy S IIIs suffer from this same problem. I wish I could get a replacement or my money back, things like this happening to such High-end (expensive) phone is plain ridiculous.  I am very disappointed with you Samsung! I hope I am contacted my someone.Thank you.Update 07/13/2013This is completely unacceptable!!! This phone now freezes as soon as I reboot it when trying to unfreeze it!!! This is my second bad experience with "high end" Samsung devices!!! I will never buy from Samsung again, sorry but you lost a very good LOYAL (bought several big screen TVs, a sound bar and mobile devices all the time) customer because of this awful experience with devices I payed for $685 (Note II) and $630 (Galaxy Tab 10.1 that had very bad screen problems.I hope at least anyone in here takes the time to contact me.
+	This phone is slammin'! That's urban slang for, it's a really nice phone. I'm not going to provide any technical details, but I will say that for the price, this phone delivers a lot of good stuff in a really nice package. The phone is well built, stylish and has many features that any good smart phone would have; it feels and operates like a more expensive phone. It's a great deal. I purchased this for my young daughter and she enjoys using it to watch videos, connect to the internet-Netflix, Youtube, listen to music both online and downloaded-her favorite One Direction boy band-easy to do from my PC(Windows7 to her Windows 8 phone). And yes, she can talk and text with ease.
+	yea youll miss some apps the i phone has but not many. this is a great phone and work great. i did have to return the first phone because the data wasnt working. but i went to tmoble and got the same phone and its awesome. if you do the prepaid it only$50 per month if you do the same plan on there contract its $60 with taxes ect. just remember over the course of the year it all adds up.great for email apps ect. and the phone works well... imagine that. buy it you wont regret. if your a heavy iphone user and cant see your self not using the exact same app as apple has then maybe the phone is not for you.
-	Do NOT get this phone! Its slow it lags turns itself off and all around just does not work well.
+	Arrived right on time, and have been using it for a month or so now. It has been working great! Very user friendly, stylish appearance, very good sensitivity, and tons of wonderful apps. I love listening to music, so I love the Nokia Music app. My mom loves the Nokia Here Drive app, which has by far been the most accurate gps for driving we have used, and we have used a lot.... My mom even said she prefers this phone over her iphone 4s. :) Some people said the camera sucks, but even with no flash, it works fine! It came installed with 2 camera apps(?) and I tested them both. One was blurry, but the other one was super clear. There is no rear facing camera, so if you love taking selfies, look for  a different phone, but for me, this is perfect. Will definitely order another Nokia phone next time.
+	I never thought i will be using a Windows phone, but this little Nokia made me change my mind. great call quality (sending and receiving). this little phone picked up my wifi printer hound dog and I can print from the phone, scan from my printer but using the phone to initiate the scanning and the scanned image lands in my phone. size is great and the price is great. very happyAlso, the phone was shipped for free and it took three days to arrive in my mail box,  great experience with Amazon. thanks,
+	T-Mobile and Nokia should be proud of this phone: on the T-Mobile network, it is the best basic smart phone you can buy.Lots of folks want a small, light, durable and easy to use phone at an affordable price. They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email. They don't care about 3D action games or downloading dozens of apps.The 521 is a great phone for basic use. If you live in a city with T-Mobile's 4G HSPA service your emails will download rapidly (check the coverage map at the T-Mobile website BEFORE buying).If you just want to send text messages and read your email, a $600 phone is a waste of money. The Nokia Lumia 521 is perfect for your needs. And, it is nice looking. The new Iphone 5c has colorful back covers... Apple noticed the 521 (and its popularity) and "borrowed" its style.By the way, T-Mobile now owns MetroPCS. Both the 521 and prepaid service for it cost less at MetroPCS stores than anywhere else. Just $49 or $29 after rebate until March 1st.
+	This is my first touchscreen phone and i gotta say i love it. Awesome apps market. It does take a while for some apps to load but its not the end of the world if it takes an extra second to load. Very Happy with this phone. And it came unlocked just like stated and so far no issues battery life could be better but then again it is a smartphone bein used nonstop.
-	Horrible phone can't get picture messages it's constantly dropping calls. The internet sucks on it. A total waste of money and I bought two and my daughter is having the same problem with hers.I will not be purchasing cell phones  online again I will go in the store.
+	This is SUCH a good phone!!! I love it so much and the price was awesome, especially for how good a phone it is! The ONLY reason I took off a star is bc there is no front camera. And that really isn't even that big of a deal, it just makes it a little harder to take selfies, but it's ok. Get this phone NOW!!:):):):)
+	I like bargains.  I'm retired, live on a fixed income, and am always searching for ways to stretch a dollar.  The Nokia 521 may be the best bargain going in smartphones.I'll begin by saying that this is my FIRST smartphone.  Wal-Mart offers this Family plan deal (no contract) through T-Mobile for $29.99 monthly for unlimited phone and texts.  For $10 more, you can purchase a plan that provides unlimited data.  I thought, "Finally, here’s a plan I can afford, now I just need to find the right phone to pair with it."  The Lumia 521 and the Wal-Mart plan is a match made in heaven.First, some quick background ... all I was searching for was a simple phone.  I had a flip phone but I guess I yielded to the pressure of having a device that many consider outdated.  This phone cost a little more but what the heck.  I think I ended up paying $59.99 for this puppy.  It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.  Perhaps I've been living under a rock but I didn't realize a handheld phone could do so much.I read the reviews before making the purchase and after having purchased the phone, wonder how it can be criticized at all.  It works as advertised and if you're familiar with Windows, it's very easy to use and navigate.  I find Windows 8 to be very intuitive despite using Windows XP on my desktop.  Others have written more detailed reviews so I won't get into all that it can do.But I'll tell you this: I can check my emails, use it as a calculator, view my bank account, use it as a scanner for receipts or whatever, use it as a map, address book, people or business finder, stay updated with the latest news, cruise the internet (with virtually no lag time), watch movies, or do just about anything that I can do on my desktop computer.  I added a memory card and now have over 4 GB of songs I can listen to when I'm out and bored.  It even has a 5 MP camera that allows me to take pictures of my Grand kids! Oh, I also downloaded an app that allows me to use it as a pedometer to track my daily walk/exercise efforts.All I can say is those that complain about the phone obviously forget IT ONLY COSTS 60 BUCKS!  Because of its affordability, it won't have all the bells and whistles that other, far more expensive, smartphones would have but for the cost, it more than fits the bill.  I am so impressed with this Nokia model that in a year or so, I intend to upgrade and get the more expensive 1020 (the specs of the camera are the industry best).  It's funny, but owners of more expensive phones look at mine and are genuinely impressed.  They cannot believe it does about as much as their more expensive phones at a fraction of the cost.My recommendation, for what it's worth, is this:  If you're on a budget and looking for an affordable smartphone, I think you'll be very happy with this model.  IMO, Nokia got it right!
+	Great phone, smooth, fast and easy to use. You can actually open word, excel and PP files on the phone, anywhere you happen to be.
+	purchase for my son he loves it works well features are great , I think I will order one for myself.
-	The shipper was great but the phone, no fault of his is not that great. Unless you live in a strong area near a pole, this phone can not even pick up the 3G signal. I have had 4G that worked fine, but this one is weak. Staying with my IPhone.
-	Terrible customer service..... The equipment did not work with pop mails, it erases the email without reading, it's not a problem of configuration. This device apparently has this problem. Additionally we tried to contact the seller several times and did not get any answer. To top this, Samsung America does not help you with a solution to any problem regarding an unlocked phone because this equiptment comes from another provider outside America. Very disported overall.
+	I love the phone. So far the only thing I can't figure out it's how to sync Facebook to my contacts. Is there a way?
+	I have a 2 year contract with Tmobile and my phone broke, but i dont have an upgrade, so I bought this, and my sim card from the old phone didnt fit, so i put the new one that came with the Nokia in and it didnt have any of my contract info, so if you have a contract, just call your provider, tell them you bought this phone and need to register it under your number, you just tell them your number then the number of the new sim card (its on the bottom of the box and its on the card the sim card comes with) you just tell them the number and then wait 10-15 minutes reset the phone and you should start recieving texts, calls, and have internet access
-	THIS PHONE IS A WASTE OF MONEY YOU CANT USE THE INTERNET EVEN IF YOU HAVE WIFI YOU STILL CANT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET. IT CANT EVEN GET 4G OR 3G ITS A WASTE OF MONEY...
-	the phone is not a refurished phone it a used phone  will never but them again nextel rugged motrola I680
-	I bought this phone refurbished under the assumption that there were no problem with it. . All three buttons on the bottom ofthe phone ddoesn't light up. My back light was flickering and went out in two days after I received it. . So basically I was lied to. .
-	This was my first straight talk phone and it was great for about a month...now my phone doesn't ring or alert me at all for anything. My alarm doesn't even work on it...all it does is vibrate so I am very unhappy with this phone and looking for a new phone.
-	Finally got the phone and does not work. Womt activate or stay on for that matter. Keeps turning off and on. Its also not the droid razr. Its a cheap imitation, you can tell by looking at it. And you stull got to deal with the crap of returning stuff.
-	Definite pig in a poke. Had better speed with dial up. Talk and text are mediocre at best. Almost none of the apps work.Paid for one day shipping and got the package 5 days later. Not happy at all.$120 total for an electronic paperweight!!
-	Quality control must really be bad as of the reviews I read I'm not the only one not liking this phone. One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.  T-mobile sent me a new battery that didn't help.  1 day lasted 8hrs and I wasn't using it.  No applications were running as all I use it for is texting and phone and that day didn't use it.  T-mobile send me a replacement which I will start using today but cost me $20.00 to get a new one.  I should have returned it Amazon but like a fool didn't..  Now am stuck with it but maybe the new one will be OK.  I can only hope these days.
+	Good phone, better than I've expected. Front camera would make it an excellent phone. I have no regrets so far,
-	Purchased this phone for my daughter a few days ago. The first day it function well, by day two it started turning off by itself, just can't seem to get it to stay on. This item is surely not one of my best purchased.
-	This phone has a factory defect that cannot be fixed, except by sending it back to LG repair.The memory of the phone doesn't work properly. And even though at the begining the phone will work perfectly, at some point the memory of your device will fail. Making the device unable to boot. if you notice that your phone starts to turn off by itself, then better backup all your information, because is about to fail for good. And you will not be able to recover your info.Had this phone for a few months and then I got the error. Don't bother trying to cool booting the device, it's a HARDWARE issue, so the only way to fix it is with a replacement.
+	Needed a phone for an emergency (my Galaxy SIII died), this has been great and the price unbeatable. recommend it!
+	For the price the functionality and look of this phone is a smokin deal!  It is definitely not an outdated phone it has all the functionality as a galaxy or an iPhone. And actually I prefer this over my iPhone.  I loved it so much that I purchased another one for my daughter who is very young and tech savvy. Which replaced the Nokia n8 phone I just bought her 6 months ago. (n8 has way better camera but that is it)This still has a good camera but no flash but nothing the right lighting wont solve. We actually just discovered the feature where we can voice accept text messages, have them read to us and then speak our reply back all without ever touching the phone. Which comes in handy for sure.  I felt like I was spending hours a day just texting but now it is a breeze and I don't have to stop or put down something just to read and reply to someone's text.This phone is the best one in the category of pre-paid touchscreen windows phones priced 0-$200. AND this phone is only $100 so  I highly recommend it!
-	This phone is not good it's very slow was not happy at all with it will not never buy it again
+	The best price for a non-contract phone. Comes with SIM card (fyi). Only annoying part is that the buttons at the bottom, on the touchscreen, do not light up in the dark. Overall, excellent for the price.
+	I DEARLY LOVE THIS PHONE DOES LOTS MORE THAN I EXPECTED AND HAS 1 CAMERA PLUS YOU CAN DOWNLOAD 3 MORE CAMERA SITES .........ALL 4 TAKE WONDERFUL PICTURES - CLEAR TOO.
+	I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone.Pros:- The tile interface is superb, easily customizable and easy to use.- The screen is pretty amazing.- The camera is pretty darn good and you get a lot of really good photo apps (Panoramic photos etc.)- Very resilient; I dropped from a considerable height and the only thing that happened was that the plastic case and the phone itself got separated.- I actually like the plastic case; makes it feel modern and playful- Windows actually has a lot of really good apps. You can get Whatsapp, Amazon Kindle, Facebook, Twitter etc., but also many smaller and fun apps- Very good maps, available offline as well- Pretty gast processing and speedy with the WiFi- The sound is also a strong point. You can really hear videos or music pretty well- Speaking of music: you can get Nokia music, that also has integrated mix radios for free.- Easy to configure for Office (you can edit spreadsheets!), but also for Google products- Good size; easily manageable in your handCons:- if you use it a lot, the battery will go in a day (I guess it's proof of how much you're using it, because it's so good)- No front facing camera, so no Skyping.Really, I love this phone. For the price, it's probably one of the best smartphones out there. I don't see why I'd pay 600$ for a fancy iPhone or for a bulky Galaxy S4 when this phone can get me through the day and be super fun.
-	Mine crapped out at 14 months and nobody in USA can fix it.  Moreover, there is NO VALID US WARRANTY on this device.  I'v learned that the UK has a 2 year warranty, but they will not accept it for repair unless it is mailed from a UK address.Don't bother with this one and check any other unlocked deals from Amazon for warranty.
-	My old Motorola 265 is having cut-out problem occasionally so I decide to upgrade to a new phone.  I signed two-year contract and get this phone for free from the Verizon website.  Then my headache started.The new phone looks nice and works nice except the speakphone is not as loud as my Motorola 265.  But since the second day I got this phone, I found I'm having much worse cut-out problem than my old phone.  I had to call Verizon for replacement.  The first replacement only works worse than the original one.  So, replace again.  The second replacement still has the cut-out problem but I have no energy to care about this problem any more --- its speakerphone totally doesn't work!  I need the speakerphone everyday when I chat over the phone with my husband.Verizon is not happy either.  Their CS told me they can not ship me again and again and I don't trust their service any more.  Therefore I brought this phone to the local store.  But the local store can not do exchange for me because my account shows my cell phone has only 3 months warranty(??!!).I'm so tired but I still have to call Verizon.  Today they told me they are going to ship me another model, Motorola V325i.  I checked customer review on Amazon and only to find very bad reviews.  I don't know how the new one will work but I'm just too tired to argue with them any more.From the three Nokia 6215i phones I've got, I can tell that its speakerphone is generally soft (but my current one totally doesn't work).  If a speakerphone feature is important for you, keep away from this model.
-	I have had this phone for 6 weeks with no damage done to it and it just stopped working and would not respond to any troubleshooting. Nokia will not replace the phone, but rather will attempt to repair it. When all is said and done, I will be without my mobile for about 3 weeks and will have lost all my data on the phone. This is completely unacceptable to me and I am so disappointed in this purchase. I have never written a review on any product before, but this warrants it!
-	A phone I wouldn't recommend to anyone , basically the phone is just big it doesn't do that much the volume is bad on it also.
+	As a developer, I can feel the stark contrast between a Macbook Pro (SSD, 16GB RAM and a quad-core CPU, nothing less) and a Windows laptop.A Windows phone was unthinkable for me. At the same time, I am smart enough to not spend 600-700$ on a smartphone. My old feature phone was crushed under my car when I forgot to keep my handbag inside. I was waiting for the smartphone prices to come down so that the phone doesn't own me. I was considering Nexus 5, but I saw an ad for this phone for 70$ and after reading a few glowing reviews on Amazon, I felt confident to buy this. It is only 70$, not 700$. I also have an Ipod Touch 4th generation and an IPad 3rd gen. This phone is definitely faster than the Ipod, and pretty decent for email, weather, calendar checking and other daily activities. I am not a power user and I have a feeling that this phone won't get obsolete for me for another two years.
+	I was skeptical about getting a windows phone. I've grown to love android and so I wasn't sure if I should try anything else. I can't stand iPhones as I feel android is better but coming from android I really do like this phone. Granted it doesn't have all the things that android does BUT nevertheless it is a very good phone. A lot of people complain about the apps but I didn't find them to be a problem. The store does have good apps and some that are very similar to those on the android market. Some people don't like it just because the name is different but if it does the same thing who cares?? Anyway, its a good phone and I love it!!
+	I had an Android phone previously that I didn't like due to it shutting down in the middle of applications and various other issues. I haven't had any issues with this phone.  It is my favorite phone thus far!
-	Worse cell phone ever just buy this phone and it a waste of money I would not recommend this phone to no one
-	I purchased a Blackberry Storm 2 9550 "listed as new" as a gift for my niece, and after only 2 months of start using it, the phone keeps shouting down for no reason. We try a new battery, but it shouts down and it does not turn on. I paid $229.93 for this phone and I really feel so embarrassed with my niece and her parents. This was a real rip off.  Amazon should screen people and sellers using this site to sell their products, and should not allow sellers to list items as new when they are not new.I DO NOT recommend this seller. I am very disappointed.
-	I was sent a sprint i phone not a verizon. couldnt get it to work through verizon. Lost money on the trade in.
-	Samsung corporate told me on chat that they do not make a factory unlocked, non-carrier version of the phone. Odd, since it seems to be right here, and there's over 30 5 star reviews. Then again, salesmen know people look for that when they consider buying. I wonder how hard it would be for salesmen to get online and write a ton of great 5 star reviews that sound really genuine and believable.Here's another question. Why is it out of all these reviews, nobody seemed surprised to get a carrier version? Odd that--since several Samsung techs were VERY clear to me that THEY ONLY MAKE CARRIER VERSIONS, and these must be purchased through the carriers.I wonder who's lying here. Since I sold cell phones for over half a decade, I can tell you first hand that aside from the very basic, immediately verifiable facts, you can't believe a word they say. They'd sell you your own suicide if they could get away with it.
+	I purchased the Nokia Lumia 521 as an upgrade for my mother from her feature phone. I have long been a fan of Windows Phone (Samsung Focus/Lumia 920 owner) and knew she would find it intuitive and easy to use. I was a little concerned about the build quality, it being such a cheap phone and all. I know Nokia makes excellent phones and this one is no exception. It feels fantastic in the hand and I almost bought one for myself just to have. Software features are nearly the same as high end Windows Phones, with a few small limitations (mainly games). Sure, there's no flash and the screen isn't the best around but, when you're paying such a low price for such a nice phone, you can't complain. Inclusion of a microSD card slot for expanded storage and Nokia's range of excellent (and exclusive) apps are major pluses for the 521. Everything runs buttery smooth and efficiently and the Windows Phone Store is quickly gaining traction with developers. Everyday new apps are announced with some "heavy weight" apps announced/released recently. Couple all of this with contract free T-Mobile and you have yourself a winner. I highly recommend this phone.
-	The PTL 600 is the biggest mistake that I have ever made in consumer electronic purchases!  While the GPS locks very fast, I find the Ostia maps to be outdated and lacking in detail.  If I would have taken every turn that this unit suggested, I probably wouldn't be here to write a review.  Even though the maps are poor, they still take up most of the memory on this device.  Unless you like to carry around extra microSD cards in your pocket, be prepared to be disappointed.  Also, I've had a lot of problems trying to charge the phone with the flimsy USB/charge cable included (the AC power adapter works fine).  Finally, the customer service is the worst that I've ever seen.  I sent my phone to them on an RMA for problems with the display in March (after hours of hold music and unreturned email), and I still haven't received it back.  If you are comparing devices in this price range, you might want to take a look at the HP iPAQ Travel Companion (rx5910/5915)-  I'm going to.  If your still interested in Pharos, watch for cheap used handhelds.  Mine is still under warranty, and I hope to sell it soon (if I ever get it back!)
-	I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used. I was on the phone with t mobile for hours only to find that the card was already used and not a prepaid card. We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile. I would not recommend this product or service to anyone one. This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
-	The phone worked fine for 4 days but all of a sudden it won't turn on anymore. When I plug it in, it says its charging so I've been charging it for a couple of hours but the phone still won't turn on. Never buying a Nokia again.
+	I love nokia phones from the beginning as it is!The menu bar, at first seemed strange but I used to it for the second day. It works great with skype, and viber also. The touch screen is easy to use, much more easier than the Samsung phones!
+	I waited a week to write this review, so my opinion would be more informed.  I use it with the T-mobile pay as go plan, with no data plan (so I just use wifi). My first smartphone was Windows 6.5, then I went to Android, so moving to Windows 8 was completely new.  After a week, I can say that I love it.  Yes, there are a few apps (Instagram, Charles Schwab, Safeway) that aren't available on this platform, but the ones that are offered all work with no problem. Unlike Android, where it was "the good, the bad, and the ugly."Physically, it feels fantastic in your hand.  What I like best, though, are the camera features.  The shutter button is on the right lower side, perfectly placed to click if you are holding the camera in your right hand.  Regarding the "lenses," I didn't understand that at first, but what it means is that there are several picture editing apps available, and they are grouped together when you open the camera, so that you can select them whenever you are taking pictures.All in all, I think it is a great phone, and the ridiculously low price makes it a no-brainer.
+	Was very surprised how nice this phone is for the price. Does everything I need it to do plus so much more.Very happy with it.
+	If you're looking for a basic smartphone, then look no further. The Nokia Lumia 521 provides basic functionality and is definitely a good buy for the money. If you want something that has a lot of bells and whistles, this is probably not the phone for you, unless you'd rather save a hundred bucks than get something fancy. The limited amount of apps available for windows phone is a little frustrating (I had assumed the offering would be similar to what is available for Android, but it's not), and the games that I have installed seem to be just a little overwhelming for the processing power of this phone. However, the internet is excellent, and the texting autocomplete is among the best I've encountered. Overall, worth the price.
-	Had to many issues returned item, thought the unlocked version would've worked with any carrier had some minor issues each time I powered phone off and on at the end of the night and start of the new day.  Really looked forward to using phone I like Blackberry very much.
+	I just chose this phone over an iPhone 5s and let me just say I am not disappointed. This phone is great and it is also $600 less than the iPhone 5s. After trying both phones out and comparing both of them I knew that going with the Nokia Lumia 521 was the right decision. For the price of this phone you can't go wrong.
+	If Microsoft and Nokia are able to garner a profit from this product, then the future may bode well for both of them, indeed. If they can come up with products of the same price/performance ratio across their lines of tablets and computers and what have you, they will be hard to ignore in their marketplaces. A real alternative to the likes of i-Phone, a superbly thought-out design in hardware and software, at a bargain price. The Lumia 521 combines perfectly with T-Mobile's competitive range of plans, but can also be enjoyed as a smartphone without plan (i.e. without phone use). AT&T; offers the technically identical Lumia 520 at an attractive price without contract.On my wishlist for Windows Phone 8:- deeper integration of speech recognition, not just available for web searches and translation and few others but throughout all apps imbedded in keyboard- more access to folder structure and files not just on Skydrive but on the hard drive and on the SDcard as well- tech support by Microsoft for Windows Phone OS (currently non-existent). It would not only benefit users but also provide Microsoft valuable feedback for their still nascent OS. Take note of Amazon.com launching their "Mayday" live video support button on their new generation of Kindle Fires!

The speeds are quick enoughFor me I get around 2mps download 3mbps upload that's quiteEnough for me . I don't really need LTE  I do suggest you buy aPhone cover and a screen protector and the battery last me allDay long REALLY AMAZING PHONE GLAD I BOUGHT ITI RECOMMEND GETTING THE GAME CALLED ZOMBIETSUNAMI IT'S SO FUN AND ADDICTING
+	Let me first start of by saying, this is an amazing phone! I bought it as a cheap entry into Windows Phone 8, and I'm completely blown away. I wasn't expecting this. This phone was going to be something I use as a backup, but I'm currently using this as my daily driver, and I love it!Let me also say, that I'm not new to the world of smart phones. I consider myself a techie enthusiast that buys and tries new phones / tech every few months or so. I've been on every phone carrier, and tried every platform except for WP8 (until now). I've also picked up every iPhone released (1st gen to iPhone 5), and I'm HEAVILY invested in Google services. I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2). My most recent love has been the pureness of the LG Nexus 4. The fact that I'm impressed with this budget device is no small thing.Pros:-Fantastic Battery Life - (Appears to hold its charge while on stand by like an iPhone. Unlike Android phones that continue to drain heavily even without use. The phone also charges fairly quickly since the battery only rated at 1430mAH).-Great Nokia Construction - (Nokia does an amazing job with plastics. Remember the days of the old Nokia 3300's? You could drop those things over and over again without worry. I have nearly the same confidence in this phone. Something you definitely don't see in other phones these days. The phone even has a good weight to it. Not the light, cheapy feeling you get from some Samsung devices).-Removable Rear Cover - (Most WP8 phones that I see - even other Nokia ones - don't have a removable back. I was very pleased to see one on the 521. Scratch or crack a back? No problem! Replace it. Hopefully there will be some 3rd party support here making other colors and designs. I haven't had the need for it yet, but I can't tell you how many battery pulls I've had to do with some of my Android phones. I like knowing that if I ever have to reset my phone, I'm just a pop of the cover away. Even the buttons come off with the cover! This means if you ever have wear on the buttons, it'll be replaced with the new cover you put on there as well).
-	The note is designed to operate in Europe and not America. I tried AT&T; and T-Mobile and none of the apps worked. All I could do was listen to my music and make and receive calls. The site did not address this in the information about the phone.
+	I wanted a phone around $100 since I am saving up for a car.This is a huge upgrade from my old non-smart phone. I love it and recommend it to anyone who is unhappy with android or apple phones.Or if you want a good phone that doesn't cost you $25 a month for the next year or 2.
+	For the price, the hardware is really good. Windows Phone takes some adjusting to, once you become familiar with the paradigm it has a number of nice features and advantages. The Live Tiles can be really useful for putting information right on the home screen.If you primarily use a phone as a phone, and don't have to game or have the latest most amazing features, this is a good phone. But don't expect it to be iPhone, or Android, its just different.
+	This is one great little phone that actually get things done. I am really surprised. There are two things that must be clarified if you just got this phone and you coming from Android or Iphone. Don't expect to get all the apps you are used to. Also know that this phone is a  budget phone and so dont expect it to work like high end phones.SOME OF WHAT I LIKE:1. The audio quality and overall system is very good in fact far better than my previous two Android phones (Nexus 4 and LG G2). Voice calls are loud and clear. I am amazed at how good my music sound when I hook it up to my car stere. Very loud and clear. Makes the G2 and Nexus 4 sound like toys.2. The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone. Also like the unique physical camera button; Overall smooth UI that beats all Android phones I have used so far including the G2, Galaxy S3 and S4. It doesnt lag at all and what a relief coming from Android;3. Essential Microsoft programs like Office, Skydrive, One Note all work flawlessly just like their bigger phones like the Lumia 925 and possibly Lumia 1020. Its amazing how you can pull out this very little phone from your pocket and actually get things done.4. Battery life to a certain extent is good. It has the "battery saver" option and if checked it does a good job managing the battery usage. It also shows you the time from last charge and also the amount of time needed before the battery runs out.5. Tmobile's Wifi calling is fantastic. For those situations when you have little to no cellular coverage the phone switches to wifi and then you can make all the calls you like. You can set it to make only wifi calls or give it a priority.6. The UI is as smooth as butter. It just flows with absolutely no lag. Very impressive.7. It takes a micro SD for a change. This is great for extending storage.8. Nokia Maps gives you the ability to download entire state maps for you to use phone as off line GPS.SOME OF WHAT I LIKE LESS:1. The lack of apps can be problematic atimes but not honestly not a big deal. I knew what I was getting into but this may be an issue for many people. Most of the available apps works great.2 The IE browser keeps forcing some sites to appear on desktop mode even though the browser is set to mobile. This is a bit frustrating cnsidering how small the screen is.3. The lack of flash is noticeable in those moments of total darkness when when you need to take a picture. You will need some form of lighting for the pictures to look good. Also the lack of flash means you cant use your phone as a flashlight.  Overall I really like this phone so far. Whether it will hold on to daily usage for a long time I cant say. but considering how cheap it is and no contract it is a risk I was prepared to take.
-	The phones imei # was locked. Tmobile told me it was previously reported stolen. I had to return the phone.
-	The quality is not good,just one month since i have been bought!The quality is not good,just one month since i have been bought!
+	The phone is great, durable and so much to offer for a great price. It's like having a mini windows 8 in your hand.
+	My palm pixie works great so far. The touch screen and gestures are fast and easy to learn. Texting is faster than my on my nokia 2610. It took me a little while to figure out how to set it up.  Little learning curve there. Tried out wi-fi, connected to home  network with no problems!I wanted a phone I could use with page plus so this worked out great. Thank you.
-	Do NOT Buy this product. . I normally don't write reviews but this phone is by far the worst I EVER purchased. Both front and back camera are awful. My phone stopped working altogether 3 days after it was purchased AND it cracked after falling on carpet. I paid $100 and if u pay over $5 your getting screwed. . It's very cheaply put together and I wish I would have reconsidered. Everything that glitters isn't gold
+	I bought this for my daughter and it is awesome. It has all the apps that she uses and the windows phone interface is very easy to understand. She gets to have her xbox username integrated with her phone. She loves it. The only thing that is missing is the front facing camera.
+	Over the past few months there is spurt in Windows apps - maybe 521/520 sales are persuading developers to seriously look at windows platform. Most (not all, but still) of my apps from Android are now available AS-IS in Windows.For pound for pound best phone out there.Free Offline maps, FM radio receiver, external memory slot, sturdy & Nokia.Gave up my SIII & nexus S with ICS for this.Don't miss my android except for front facing camera.
-	I foolishly took a samsung s3 update the day of release and now my phone has been bricked. And Sprint said for $600 you can get a new phone!DO NOT UPDATE YOUR PHONE WITH ANY PATCHES FROM SAMSUNG FOR MONTHS UNTIL THEY HAVE FIXED THEIR BUGS
-	I PURCHASED MY PHONE ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO, EVERYTHING WAS GOING FINE TILL IT STARTED FREEZING, RESTARTING BY ITSELF, WOULD GO OFF AND COME ON, THIS WAS REALLY UPSETTING COS I LIKED THE PHONE. WELL STICK WITH A BRANDED PHONE WHERE YOU CAN BE SURE OF SUPPORT, THIS PHONE IS RUBBISH.
-	Volume very low, no signal,will not find my location so I can't use my gps, try to send back their system will not print return slip
-	would be a handy little phone if you just need to make phone calls and check email now and again.HOWEVER cant support basic chat/mssg. sites, design/layout makes camera use difficult and frequently need to TURN PHONE OFF to hang up a call.So spend a little extra on a Motorola etc. or save your money and get basic phone.
+	I had just bought the Nokia Lumia 900 and returned it because of a known connection issue. I read the reviews on the Lumia 521 on Amazon and bought it. Wow am I glad I did. I absolutely love this phone. It is a perfect size for me. I wasn't crazy about how big the 900 was. This phone is a little smaller and fits nicely in my hand. Not like a Tablet like other phones.  I like the windows scrolling start page instead of icons. I like the constant picture scroll. The screen size is smaller than the 900, but no less enjoyable for me. I will say that the 900's screen seemed to "pop" more than the 521, but the 521 still has a nice color pallet. I am pleasantly surprised with the speed of the Internet. I can't find anything to dislike about this phone and I don't know how Nokia or Amazon can sell it so cheaply. This has to be the best deal in windows phones - or any phone  - today.
+	For $70 I wasn't expecting a lot, especially when similarly priced phones were soo... dated? The 521 browses the web with ease and seems to run apps smoothly. I don't see this being my long term phone but for my first smart phone I couldn't be happier and I know whomever I eventually give this to will enjoy it just as much.Pros:Cheap, stylish, wifi calling, 4G speeds, GSMCons:Gets very warm when playing games. Limited 3rd party apps. Low memory means having too many things open can cause an app to crash.Conclusion:If you're on the fence about this phone then just get it. I was debating getting a smart phone for several months and researching which one would be best for me. The top end smart phones obviously have a lot more appeal but the differences are honestly minimal. Windows phone OS is light weight and runs smoothly even on this low end device. I would choose the 521 over most iphones and samsungs made before 2013.
+	My first smart phone and its obvious that its smarter then me. Will be learning how all the bells and gongs work for the next year. My old cell phone rang, I answered or I called on it. Live so much easier back in the stone age.
+	My Daughter wanted another phone she goes through them like they're going outa style except I am trying to teach her to take care of what she has nice phone.....
+	I Love my new phone the slim line style is perfect. I also likes the fact it has windows @ my fingertips, and several Apps, and Wi-Fi accessible. Just wish my text would have transferred over.
+	bought this for my son and it works great and the money spent, it was really worth it, would recommend
-	do not deal with worldwide. They lied about my phone when I tried to return it. they told me they would give me a refund and then try to stiff me. they told me my phone came back wet after I returned it and they wanted to give me a 60 dollar credit on a $500 phone. after about 20 hours on the phone and my time Amazon finally fixed the problem for me and refunded me correctly. they seem to have changed their name since I bought their phone which is probably commonplace for them. if you should use them, ask them a lot of questions first. especially which network you will be on because they don't tell you in there an ad and then you will get stuck with the wrong phone without asking the right questions.good luck.
+	Forget the fact that its only 115 bucks, forget that its a no contract unlocked phone, because this Nokia product is amazing. The windows 8 system is the best I've ever used if u don't buy this you will regret. It for sure.
-	Firstly, this cell phone is not a new one, the box should be open before. What's important, the cell phone is a bad one, it does't work!! When I put my SIM card in it, there's no response!!! Now I'm not in America, I just cannot return it right now. I'm soooooo angry about it!!!!
+	I purchased this phone for my niece.  She seems to like it all except it does not have a front face camera.
+	Phone arrived as described for an excellent price; noting this is the to-go/no-contract phone, be aware, but don't be deterred. It is the same phone as the one sold in the store.This phone would have cost me $140.00 in the store, but I only paid $79.99 on this to-go phone from amazon.com. Good idea for the budget conscious. The T-mobile call center can tell you that I refuse to pay $700.00 for a phone. I have held out since the inception of Smart. This phone was what I was waiting for. As far as I can tell, this phone does everything the Samsung Galaxy SIII does, with the exception of the share function (and who needs that, I mean really.) I can use the wi-fi to run my Kindle, which is important when traveling extensively. I was surprised to find that the wi-fi is almost as fast as my cable wi-fi and that is on the tier two data plan; I may bump up to the highest tier, and cut my cable internet. More economical; looking at hot spot. I can edit word, excel, and ppt docs (!!) and windows is getting instagram soon (not certain if I want that anymore, but hey). The most important improvement on this phone over my last, is the crystal clear calling; my family members sound like they are actually in the room with me, it's awesome. Nokia is supposed to be a very reliable and trustworthy phone. I am so excited about this phone, that when people call me, I actually pick up!Important Tip: This is my first smart phone. My SIMS card was 10 years old and too big to fit the device. (Device requires a micro-SIMS). I panicked initially, then called T-Mobile customer service, and the lady at the call center was so kind and knowledgeable; she noted my account to provide a free micro, since my original was outdated and did not fit. Went to the local store as directed, and they set me up beautifully.I've been with T-mobile for 10 years. I've never been disappointed. Best customer service, and best rate plans.
-	Avoid this product as well as FGS Trading (the Amazon seller that supplied my phone).  The phone worked beautifully for 6 months.  After an over the air update, the phone now freezes at the Samsung logo.  I am told that this is the sudden death bug that affects the hardware on the Note 2 and some S3's.  I have been trying to get the phone serviced for the last 3 weeks which should be trivial since it has a 24 month warranty. Guess again. FGS Trading says that after 60 days they will not support it.  Samsung USA cannot service it since it is international. Samsung UK service center cannot accept a shipment from outside the UK.  No one has a record of the IMEI number or the country of origin for this "factory unlocked phone". Still no headway with Amazon's A-Z guarantee. You have been warned.** UPDATE **It is now 7 weeks since my phone died after the over the air update. Amazon A-Z keeps denying my claim because they want letterhead saying the phone is under warranty. Samsung USA won't touch the device since it was manufactured in France. Found a Samsung help Center in UK and they verified the date of manufacturer indicating the phone is still eligible for 24 month warranty but that they cannot provided letterhead. Forwarded the email to Amazon A-Z service. They are still denying my claim on the basis that it is not on letterhead. Call in help desk at Amazon is polite and tries to be helpful. But there is no way to send emails, call or in anyway directly contact the Amazon A-Z claims people even to give them the information they request. The Amazon A-Z guarantee so far is headache, smoke and mirrors. Hopefully you will never have to depend on them especially to back a $700 defective product.
-	Device stopped working after 2 days and will no longer power on. Tried all button combinations to force a reset and nothing works. Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either. All in all a really terrible and disappointing experience.
-	It's so great bless Jesus for creating this miracle the Nokia Lumia 521. Life won't be the same without it. Free BIBLE APPS! NOT!!!!!
+	ordered it for my daughter after she broke her Iphone and i wasn't about to spend $600 on a new iphone.  she picked this one online and we ordered it and she totally loves it - says its better than the i phone.  success!
+	I recently received this phone and I have to say that I am pretty impressed so far. It seems to have a pretty good antenna because the signal quality is a lot better than my LG Optimus L9 on the T-Mobile network which makes a difference when you live in a place where it is difficult to get a signal. One thing that really stands out to me and which I like a lot is the Windows 8 OS on the phone, it is well thought out especially Internet Explorer, I like how the address bar is on the bottom and not the top.  As a web and mobile designer I can really appreciate it.  Microsoft was always seemingly behind the curve with their web browsers and they can be a real pain to develop for as you have to do all sorts of hacks at times in order to get websites to render correctly, but not so with the mobile version of their browser, I think they really thought this one through and so far I like it better than mobile Safari and mobile Chrome. Overall a really nice phone and you will be hard pressed to beat the price. My iPhone 5 costs $649 and if I didn't need it for work and I just needed a single phone for personal use, I would probably just go with the Nokia Lumina 521. Hope that this helps someone out there who is trying to decide.
-	Not expandable to 64gb... there is a slot for a 64gb card, but the phone cannot access or use it to store anything.  Cannot move apps, movies from Google Play, or any other media.  Its useless.
+	Phone is super fast, Windows 8 is great, 64 gig storage makes this phone into a computer, 1000s of free apps, I don't even use my I-Pod any more, phone is a perfect size and is very sturdy.
-	We had this phone for about 5 weeks and touch screen would no longer work.  I tried to have it repaired but was too costly.
+	This phone is easy and very user friendly. Bought this for my 12yr and he loves it. Recommend highly. Perfect!!!!
+	You won't find a better device for the money. It has 75% of the features you'll have in the highest end phones at 25% of the cost.
-	This was a terrible phone. It was only 20 bucks, so you get what you pay for. This phone may be okay for a first phone for like a 8yr old or something.
+	like many, I purchased this phone as a cheap stop gap phone until I saved up for my next phone.  4 months later, I am still using this phone, and my motivation to purchase another has been dwindled to nothing by this phone.
+	Been almost a year since i bought it, maybe been turned completely off 5 times in that period. Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.  Deff get iLLumiShield's for this phone along with a phone protector.My only issue is it doesnt have a flash for the camera...I knew that buying the phone and the camera does work beautifully outside and well lit insides but your living room with just a lamp or two on the photos are going to look dark or overexposed. BUT its a phone NOT a camera so dont expect it to behave like your digital camera.
+	I love this Nokia Lumia 521.  It is both elegant and so simple to use.  I was searching for a perfect cellular phone and when I received it, I found it to have everything I needed all wrapped up in one. Glad I bought it, thank you.
-	This phone was impossible to figure out. For the non-technical type, like myself, the instructions were impossible to follow. When I tried to input the necessary codes, figures, etc., the screen to insert this data on couldn't be found. Several of my more Geeky buddies couldn't understand it either. I really wanted to use and enjoy this highly recommended phone but at the end, I went to the Geek Squad, brought a Samsung Galaxy III, and a young Geek not only activated it for me, he connected me to Facebook, G-mail, etc.
-	I really wanted to love this phone in every way. It has a lot going for it as you see from the reviews.What follows this updated review is the original, I am now 10 days into this POS and 3 factory resets later, I can soundly conclude that this phone is garbage.Great ideas, built like a toy, and completely unreliable. I've had plenty of phones and never seen anything so aggravating before.BEWARE: If you are foolhardy enough to bother with this after research, make sure you don't save anything to the phone itself, only the SD card, as there is no file manager you will lose everything everytime you reset, and reset you will. Bye bye contacts, pictures (camera sucks btw), apps, all down the toilet.Buggy buggy buggy. Just Google "Nokia 521 issues," then have a good laugh at my expense, then go get yourself a reliable phone. This ain't it.Just days ago I was more optimistic... This is my older review:But here is what is what I don't like:-No forward facing camera. You might want to think about how this will affect you. Forget Skype or any other video calling, no dice. In this day and age VERY limiting. Deal breaker item. I personally will never own another phone without this camera.-Windows. You might like it or not, I personally kinda do, but if you have gotten used to the app selections of android or iPhone, this will be like stepping back in time several years. There are enough apps for me, but check out the selection first.I really don't care for the disappearing tiles all the time, what's up with that?-The screen lock is absurd. Major deal breaker. Spent a day locked out, and every time you try a password it doubles the amount of time you have to wait to try again. How stupid is that. I ended up forced to do a factory reset and lost valuable pictures and data in the process. I will never buy another phone with that obnoxious feature. Epic fail.-No file manager, really? Weak. I shouldn't have to make 7 navigations and open 3 apps just to find a simple file.I will say though:-This phone is very fast, apps usually load quick.-Good cell reception and great WiFi reception.-The keyboards are fantastic, right on queue!-I LOVE SD expandable memory. MAJOR plus.-Best touch screen I have ever owned. And my last phone was the Samsung Infuse (priced at 6 TIMES this Nokia 521). Wow.-Battery life is through the roof. I watched 6 hours of video while traveling and she had lots more in her. Pretty amazing.-Strong audio and speakers. Again, best I have owned yet. Maybe the screen lock can be worked around. Until then I refuse to use it.One thing that will make my relationship brief with the 521 is the lack of that forward camera. Shame about that.
-	I'm so disappointed about this cell. I bought it as a present to my mother in law and it's so embarrassing that the phone doesn't allow to download any applications because it keeps saying the phone's memory is full. She barely downloaded one app and she couldn't do more. The phone won't charge even if she plugs it all night. Phone calls won't come through and media text messages just won't get downloaded. Overall horrible product. I don't recommend it.
+	Update: If the price hadn't dropped to $70 or so, I'd be taking away a star today.The longer I use it, the more things I find that are annoying. The Music player is awkward and tends to play things unexpectedly. In some modes, the device will be playing a song and there's no "pause" button in evidence, just a "play" button that doesn't magically stop playing anything. The user interfaces are generally not well organized.Check lists in some apps are more difficult to use than in others. It should be a standard window widget, I have no idea why it's harder to get the checks to appear in some apps than others.Apps remain thin and the apps that do exist are so-so.There's not enough main memory in the device and/or memory is badly managed. I have a 32GB SD card in it with over 15GB free but I can't get the maps to go to the SD card, they are stuck in internal phone memory. It's awaiting  a Windows update but I don't have enough free space in the internal phone memory to run the update, so I must delete the maps to make room for the update. Yes, similarly, you can't readily load the update to the SD card and run it from there. Why fight it? I'll just delete the maps and download them again after the update is finished.It does do hotspotting fairly well, although it seems to switch itself off when it thinks you're done using the hotspot feature and that can be annoying but I'll just accept that it prevents me running up a data bill and pretend I like the behavior. It's somewhat awkward to control these things, too.I switched to a new PC with Windows 8 and it allegedly has Windows Phone support but it seems you must go to the web and get the Windows Phone App or you're left managing the phone basically as a memory device. Microsoft's message, that the Phone support is built-in, is confusing.The Internet Explorer on the phone is not a good implementation of a web browser. I have difficulty with, oh, 25% of the sites I attempt to use. I had trouble entering flight dates on Travelocity, for example.I still have an iPod Touch, the one released in '10, and I prefer it for almost all apps and activities.However, having logged in and seen that the price has fallen to $70 or so, I'm not going to take away a star. For that price, it's a decent phone and, if you don't like the way it works, get an old iPod touch and use it via the 521 hotspot to get things done.The camera remains the one unadulterated bright spot. It does take a good picture.Original Review:I've been using it for two weeks.It's a full featured smartphone at a great price (I got mine from T-Mobile at $149 plus tax). The camera is excellent at this price. The performance on apps is good and it seems to be just as good as my old phone at pulling in signals. It works fine as a hotspot (one of my reasons for purchase).There's a Windows Phone app for the PC that handles the basics of the phone nicely (it's easy to copy iTunes music playlists to the phone and it's easy to move photos back and forth). Sound quality in music mode is good.I like the live tiles idea, it's used in some of the apps I use and is a benefit.The Windows interface is generally easy to use.The navigation apps ("Here", "Drive", "Transit") are very good (seems like lightning-fast GPS acquisition). I think they could integrate between each other a bit better and I'd like the option of explicitly shutting the GPS off (maybe it can be but I haven't figured out how). The map screens are great, especially the night one. (9/25 - It would be helpful if maps could be stored on the extended memory chip - it does not seem to have an option for this. To run the Amber update, I had to delete the maps to get enough space for the update.)I like the Wi-Fi calling feature I get on T-Mobile because there are a couple places I go regularly where service isn't good but I can still make and take calls over Wi-Fi. The phone app does occasionally get confused when switching from wi-fi to 2/3/4G calling. (9/25 - Amber update didn't fix this, however, the convenience of Wi-Fi "service" means that I don't mind if it occasionally gets confused)It also receives FM broadcasts (as of the Amber update I applied on 8/28).It has a user-replaceable battery (I wish my iDevices did). (9/25 - there's a higher-capacity battery available, I'm ordering it).Still, there are some things to consider.The Windows app store is thin (but improving as of 8/29).My Yahoo! contacts integrate nicely with my iPod Touch (my former "smartphone", as it had Skype and Pinger) but not at all with the Lumia. There is a two-stage transfer process that I haven't worked through yet. Syncing would be a far better solution.The music player is not as friendly as an iPod. I can play a playlist, artist or album but it's awkward to interrupt it and move on to something else. Music playback quality, however, is good (8/29 - I'm getting used to it).I didn't pay for a data plan upgrade, so I'm limited to 500MB of unthrottled access. Using Wi-Fi is mostly seamless but switching from a "Wi-Fi preferred" to "Yeah, go ahead use my 4G allocation now for phone apps" to "Go for it, let's hotspot") involves juggling a couple of different screens. I might end up paying an extra $10/month for the 2GB service that puts this concern to rest. I'm getting through a month on less than 100MB, so maybe I should worry less about this but I am a cheapskate on phone charge. What would really help would be the ability to select telecomm modes from the home screen or a single applet.There's some sort of X-Box games tie-in in the music player... not of interest to me at all, so it's annoying.Battery life is not great. However, it uses a standard Micro-USB cable to charge, so it's easy get extra USB AC or car power adapters, extra Micro-USB cables and plug it in everywhere you go.I had to set up a link to my Yahoo! mail (mail works, as noted contacts don't) but I've declined the Microsoft ID and the Nokia ID, so far. All in all, it seems like managing IDs starts to become awkward. It's true that the iPod wasn't much better but at least it only prompts for an iTunes ID, and not separate for hardware and software (and, maybe, games and music, I haven't explored all the possibilities and I don't particularly want to).Overall, it's hard to beat at the price and, except for contacts, the device does pretty much everything I need. I'd buy it again but I hope future upgrades will iron out a few things.
+	Let me first start of by saying, this is an amazing phone! I bought it as a cheap entry into Windows Phone 8, and I'm completely blown away. I wasn't expecting this. This phone was going to be something I use as a backup, but I'm currently using this as my daily driver, and I love it!Let me also say, that I'm not new to the world of smart phones. I consider myself a techie enthusiast that buys and tries new phones / tech every few months or so. I've been on every phone carrier, and tried every platform except for WP8 (until now). I've also picked up every iPhone released (1st gen to iPhone 5), and I'm HEAVILY invested in Google services. I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2). My most recent love has been the pureness of the LG Nexus 4. The fact that I'm impressed with this budget device is no small thing.Pros:-Fantastic Battery Life - (Appears to hold its charge while on stand by like an iPhone. Unlike Android phones that continue to drain heavily even without use. The phone also charges fairly quickly since the battery only rated at 1430mAH).-Great Nokia Construction - (Nokia does an amazing job with plastics. Remember the days of the old Nokia 3300's? You could drop those things over and over again without worry. I have nearly the same confidence in this phone. Something you definitely don't see in other phones these days. The phone even has a good weight to it. Not the light, cheapy feeling you get from some Samsung devices).-Removable Rear Cover - (Most WP8 phones that I see - even other Nokia ones - don't have a removable back. I was very pleased to see one on the 521. Scratch or crack a back? No problem! Replace it. Hopefully there will be some 3rd party support here making other colors and designs. I haven't had the need for it yet, but I can't tell you how many battery pulls I've had to do with some of my Android phones. I like knowing that if I ever have to reset my phone, I'm just a pop of the cover away. Even the buttons come off with the cover! This means if you ever have wear on the buttons, it'll be replaced with the new cover you put on there as well).-Dedicated Camera Key - (From what I've read online, this is a feature implemented by WP8. I was glad to see that this transferred even down to their entry level 521. I like having quick access to my camera, and this is a feature that is rarely seen on Android devices, and has NEVER been on an iOS device. It's also a 2-stage button. 1st click focus, 2nd click snap).-Acceptable Camera - (Now, you might be wondering why this is a Pro, since the camera is only a 5mp sensor. However, considering the 5mp limitation, I was very impressed with its quality. Even in low lighting, images are very acceptable. I rate this camera higher than my iPad3 & iPod5, and probably the best 5mp phone shooter that I've seen so far).-Great Speaker - (This was something that I didn't even care about right away. Then I tried using this to play some music from Pandora, and wow. It really caught me off guard. It can get really loud without distorting).-Snappy Processor - (I can't find any lag on this thing. I can't say whether this is hardware or software since I'm new to WP8, but it certainly makes it easy for me to switch back from an iPhone 5, Nexus 4, & S3 without really noticing a difference.-Generous Storage - (8 Gigs internal, with expandable storage options. There are phones that cost 3x this that don't even give you the expandable storage option. Other phones in this price segment don't give you anything close to 8 gigs internal space).There are other great things about this phone, but these are just the things that stand out.Cons:-Screen Technology - (I'm sure Nokia cut some cost here to keep the phone at a great price, so this is in NO WAY a deal breaker, but it picks up a ton of finger prints. You can't touch this screen without leaving smudges. It's just impossible. Higher end phones use a glass that's gone through anti-smudge treatment to prevent this. Wipe your screen more often, or put an anti-smudge screen protector and you're problems are solved. No biggie).-No LED flash - (Again another way Nokia cut cost, and again NOT a deal breaker. I only use LED flash on my other phones as a flash light. Everyone knows that those tiny lights don't do crap to help dark photos anyways. If I really have to pop some night shots, I'll be busting out a DSLR or a Point & shoot).Conclusion: - If you're on the fence about this device, let me help you. Stop reading my review here, and go buy this thing! You won't find a better value anywhere else. Prior to purchasing this phone, I stood by the Nexus 4 as being one of the best value's on the market, but Nokia is really putting a different spin on things. Any Android phone that you find in this price segment will be using an old OS (you'll be lucky to get Gingerbread), & extremely dated hardware. Here you have up to date hardware with an up to date OS at a 3rd of the competition's cost.Suggestions: - Buy this at Walmart if you can find it. I got mine for $129.00 at a local Walmart. T-Mobile sells this for $150.00, and right now Amazon has it for $199.00. Also I'm currently using this on Straight Talk. I see ton's of forum posted questions asking if this will work with Straight Talk, and I CAN confirm that it does. You just have to be sure you're using a T-Mobile compatible Micro-Sim. I also had to enter the APN setting manually. After just putting my sim in, I could receive calls and texts, but no data service. After entering the proper APN settings (available on Straight Talk's website), data worked just fine.... New $700 smart phones come out everyday, but the $129 Nokia 521 is a true gem.----------------------7/26/13 UPDATE!I still can't get over what an awesome deal this is. You can now get this phone as little as $99 OFF CONTRACT / OUTRIGHT. Since purchasing this phone, I've also picked up a Samsung Galaxy S4 & an HTC One. I can honestly say, that the differences between this phone and those other 2 "Flagship" phones don't justify the price difference. I still switch to his 521 regularly, and the only thing I miss or feel I'm sacrificing is the screen quality (resolution and technology). Still, it doesn't justify a near $500 price difference. The differences aren't even all sacrifices! The 521 at times feels quicker and less buggy than my S4 (although credit must go to WP8 for that), and the rear speaker is louder.I just have a few other notes to share:Battery - I love the battery life that I'm getting with this 521. I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle. I have this phone linked to my business Exchange account, and use this phone for work regularly (so the 521 is being used fairly heavily). Also, thanks to the small battery capacity, charging this thing really is EXTREMELY quick in comparison to the HUGE battery in my S4 that takes forever to charge. I suppose I must also credit WP8 for some of that.I did have that battery sucking bug that another reviewer experienced as well. For some reason, my battery life would just go from 100% to 30% in minutes. This had me really freaked out at first. After half an hour of testing, I found the culprit to be a bad app. Pretty simple fix: deleted the app, restarted my phone. Problem solved. I didn't even have to wipe my phone or clear it of any data (other than removing the bad app).Loud Speaker - Man. I don't think paid / "Pro" Phone reviewers give this phone enough credit. The rear loud speaker on this phone is amazing. I wouldn't say the quality is as good as the Beats Audio on my HTC One, but it may very well be the loudest speaker among my large phone collection.For anyone looking at this phone thinking that it's just a cheap phone to settle on, let me assure you, this is an AMAZING value, and you won't be disappointed. You absolutely won't find a better deal than the 521. If Nokia did more advertising in the US, the 521 would kill sales of many more popular devices out there. I truly hope the 521 pushes the market to create more budget friendly devices with fewer sacrifices just as Nokia managed to do. I find it truly ridiculous that phones are costing so much that some people are having to step into financing options to pay for the "latest & greatest" devices.
-	This is not a new phone or a refurbished phone -It is a JUNK phone! But Amazon is the greatest for returns 5 stars for Amazon and a big zero for Barnyard or whatever the junk dealers name is.
+	I used Apple iPhone for a couple years but had to go to prepaid bc my bill was too high w/ Verizon, so this phone isn't necessarily a "power house" phone but its fast, user friendly, & thin w/an internal storage of around 7GB. I love that if u hold the WINDOWS button down the mic activates & will do what u tell it to such as "Text Mom I love u" or "Call work" etc. Also this phone has a feature if u press the back button it will take u to literally the last thing u were doing, whether u were on FB lookin @ a friends pic or if u were typing a note into an app, & if u hold the back key down it shows u the last 8ish things u did! The tiles change sizes & colors, it also synces with your windows desktop or laptop or tablet account.  .. & it showed up when they said it would!
-	i highly don't request this phone it has been giving me lots of problems and I just got it about 4 months ago. I havnt been able to use it and I need to upgrade soon.it wont last you very long if you have one or just got one. it wont accept my Microsoft account and it is a pain. don't get this phone. it is a big fat piece of trash.
-	Purchased this phone excited nokia was back on the scene and being Scandinavian myself and being a long time nokia fan, first phone had massive software issues and i couldnt hear people through at all speaker phone/regular after i checked my voicemail!! you could literally FEEL the phone glitch out and loose the speaker after accesing voicemail. NOW, the replacement will not find the tmobile network after switching to wifi, EVER, a reset is required every time i leave my office. It's not made in Scandinavia, it's just chinese junk, go with any phone but this, a used s3 or 3s would be so much better, rotten junk- shame on nokia.
+	I loved the quality and the features on this phone so much that I bought an additional one for my Dad for father's day.  The only issue I had with the phone, and it has nothing to do with its operation, was  the initial difficulty of removing the back cover after which became easier upon subsequent attempts, otherwise no complaints.
+	Even after reading the reviews, this phone exceeded my expectations. I didn't realize that it already comes with a new micro SIM card so didn't need to worry about getting one of those when I switched phones.Pros:Runs well, pretty fast in doing whateverHas most all of the major appsNice touchscreen, it's extra sensitiveGreat nokia apps, like music and the here drive, which works without data.Great battery, it is very efficient with its battery usage, so although it is a small battery, I have easily made it through the day still with 50% battery left. The small battery also means it charges fastCons:No front facing cameraCan't use custom SMS sounds (small thing, but it would be nice since most every other phone has that ability)All in all, can't beat the price of $115 for this phone, since in most things it runs like one of those $500 smart phones
+	bought this phone for my 18 year old for Christmas, with the prices of smart phones being so high its ridiculousmy son loves it it he can go on line, chat, and do all those things teenagers do!!
+	I loved my phone but it just stop working for me, just when I had downloaded some many things on my new phone but u did keep your word u send a refund back an I order another phone an many more  that I got coming to me an thanks again for been loyalty to me.
-	This phone is the worst piece of s*** that Iever owned. It su*k!!! I will NEVER spend my money on any Blu product. And you guys can forget about me spreading the word about this phone, cause it ain't gonna happen. I cannot recommend nobody to buy this crap.
-	After much research we bought this phone because it is on the Verizon network.  After setting it up, we found it only gets one or two bars on reception.  My neighbor gets great reception on Verizon (with an older non I-phone) and my niece checked her Verizon I phone in our house and she had all bars showing.  We even took the phone outside and still poor reception.  It doesn't make sense other then the prepaid (Straight Talk) Verizon signal is not as good as regular Verizon service or this phone has a problem.
-	I bought this phone for my wife, it worked all of three days.  When I contacted the company that sold me the phone they had my wife send the phone back. After they received the phone she was told that she would get a replacement in two days.  Then she received a call back from the same person at the company now telling her they weren't going to send her a new phone.  She told my wife that the phone now had pen marks on the back and it wasn't in the original box.  Prior to sending the phone back they were told we no longer had the original box and the phone was in excellent condition when sent back.  Just be careful when ordering anything from this company, just prey it works and you don't have to send it back.
+	This phone doesn't look fancy because of the plastic appearance. However, for this price, it is a good deal and it works just fine.
+	Awesome phone does everything that I need it to do. Great price and definitely recommend this phone.Good first phone to have as a prepaid.
+	Really good phone, just gotta take care of it, and it really depends on wat service u connect with, the phone is great big screen its a android, if u don't have good service u won't have a good data connection or high speeds and u will have calling issues, but over all I like the phone its perfect. It has 2 sim card slots so u can connect with any carrier. I recommend this phone with really good carrier.
-	I purchased this phone on March 12, 2014 from Tronic Spot.  The phone had issues with the proximity sensor from the start. The phone would make whistling noises and constantly reboot for no apparent reason.  Yesterday (May 12th),  the phone stopped reading the Sim card and now it won't boot pass the HTC screen.  If or when it does it says emergency calls only and reboots. The phone was not dropped or exposed to any liquids of any kind.  It simply just stopped working 60 days after I placed my order.  This phone has been a lot of aggravation and a complete waste of money.  I would not buy this HTC model again or make any future purchases from Tronic Spot.
+	He's planning to use it when he goes to Costa Rica, so no operational feedback yet. But it boots up just fine.
+	Pros1.  Outstanding hardware for the price.2.  Phone is surprisingly quick for only having 512MB3.  Camera is pretty good4.  I like the battery saving feature that kicks in when battery drops below 25%.  Nothing worse then not being able to make a call.5.  WiFi calling very handy feature when you have weak signal.6.  The windows tile system has grown on me actually pretty nice although not many apps really make use of it.7.  Nokia maps/GPS great feature to save wasting data.8.  Has an MicroSD card slot.9.  Phone feels sturdy in your hand.10.  Home,back, and search button not in screen area.  A lot of android phones do this and waste precious screen space.11.  Touch screen sensitivity adjustable.12.  Has a pretty good facebook app.13.  Battery life is impressive when compared to low end phones.  I get about 1 1/2 days per charge.14.  Phone has an orientation sensor but is smarter about not constantly flipping between landscape and portrait view.15.  Removable back cover.  Makes it easy to repair and replace the battery.16.  8 GB of flash storage is quite a bit for a phone in this price range.Cons1.  Lacks apps - some of popular apps missing that are found on iPhone and Android such as flipboard.  Many social media apps are made by 3rd party companies that puts banner ads in the app or you force you to pay for them.  These apps are free on iPhone or Android.2.  Some social media sites only accessible through web browser which is a poor experience in small screen such as Google Maps.  Some things don't even work through web browser such Amazon music.3.  Needs many more customization options in the settings.  Battery strength, WiFi signal, and strength auto-hide in less then a minute. Screen should be brighter and screen should not shut-off as quickly when plugged in.4.  Do not like music services available on Windows OS tries to force a Microsoft eco system on you, and selection is not as good.5.  Headphone jack is strange size so far unable to find head phones that fit it.6.  Bluetooth is very buggy.  After about 1 hour of listening to music phone will stutter and needs reboot.  Happens on both phones so highly likely is a software bug.7.  Would be nice to be able to install apps on SD card.8.  Unable to text photos.  This could be T-Mobiles fault.9.  I miss Google Now.  Google Now is a killer app that I wish was on this phone.ConclusionI consider myself an Android phone fan, but make no mistake until you get up to about $200 phones such as the Nexus 4.  You will not find a better phone.  Most phones anywhere near this price have issues with just doing basic things smart phones should do.  This phone just works.  If you are on a somewhat tight budget this is the phone to get.  Most of the problems I have listed could be fixed through software updates by Microsoft.Update 4/14/2014Windows Phone 8.0 update 3 fixes bluetooth bugs.  Still unable to text photos from what I have read this is Nokia's fault not T-Mobiles.Installed Windows Phone 8.1 Beta works great with this phone.  The update allows you to install apps on the SD card very big deal because this phone has only 8 GB.  Best cheap phone for T-Mobile until you get up to the Samsung Galaxy Light in price.  Build quality is outstanding still works as good as the day I bought it.
+	Going from an iPhone to windows 8 took some time to get use to but I did. If I can figure it out- anyone can. Love how I can set up the screen with different size tags. I'm enjoying the change.
+	Once I got used to a Windows phone I found this product to be awesome.It does everything a smart phone should and it looks great.The camera is a little weak having no flash, however at 80$, I put this phone up against any of the 200$ to 399$ phones.Very happy about this purchase
-	It's slow and the speaker doesn't work. You can't adjust the calibration it's just a waste of money. And it's nothing like a note 3
-	like the heading says, the phone itself is awesome. just received mine yesterday and i cant put it down. for some reason, i wanted to look it up on Microsoft to compare pricing and was shock to see that you can purchase this EXACT Tmobile phone directly from Microsoft for $69.99. Microsoft also list the phones value as 99.99 original. amazon through Cellular specialty list the phone at 149.99 original and sell it anywhere from 89.95 to 113.97 as of right now (just looked). basically the fact that the pricing is nowhere near as competitive as buying directly from Microsoft makes this phone a one star worthy device. BUY AT Microsoft and you will SAVE $20-40! what a rip off!
-	I bought two of these. The reviews said they were of good quality , they are very slow and not of quality.
-	I got the phone today at first everything seems good.but then it diddent charge and I had it on the charger for 5 hours and still no charge.so I don't recommend this phone to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-	El teléfono lo enviaron defectuoso, ya lo he mandado a reparar varias veces y no me ha servido para nada
+	I rarely write reviews for my purchases on Amazon.com but the Nokia Lumia 521 made me spend a good half hour typing this review up.This is an amazing phone! I bought it as an entry into Windows Phone 8 and as a backup to my Nexus 4. I was expecting it to be an eh eh phone since I had an HTC TyTn II about 5 years ago and was quite underwhelmed by the Windows Mobile experience at that time. For $95 I am simply blown away. I wasn't expecting this to happen. My intention was to use this phone as a backup, but I'm currently using this as my daily driver, and after two weeks of use I love it!I am familiar with all three major mobile operating systems. I have an iPad and an iPod, Samsung Galaxy Exhibit and Nexus 4 and now the Lumia 521 to round out the iOS, Android and WP8 operating system portfolio. Whilst I am quite content with the pure Google experience on the Nexus 4, I am just amazed by how much I like the Lumia 521.Here are some observations after about two weeks of usage.-FAST, fast, fast – There is no lag on this phone. It can hold up to the Nexus 4 without any issues. It blows the Galaxy Exhibit II out of the water about 2 miles away. Also the WP interface while loading large apps is much better than iOS or Android, I liked it when I saw it in action on Outlook.com and then the corresponding Andriod app.-Ergonomic Design / Construction – Love the battery cover and how nicely it comes off and goes back on again. Pretty light weight, right size as a phone and good balance/feel in the hand. This phone feels substantially superior to the Galaxy Exhibit II and at the same time is half price! The build quality on this phone is on par with the Nexus 4. The phone doesn’t feel cheap despite the use of plastic!-Good Battery Life - Both the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy Exhibit II lose their charge much faster than the Lumia 521. It charges much faster than the other two Android phones that I have.-Camera – Nokia Smart Cam as a default app turned on with the dedicated camera key is a great feature. It takes really good pictures for a no name brand 5MP camera. Also the picture quality is much better than Nexus 4 or Galaxy Exhibit II, at least in my opinion. Nokia Creative Studio then helps out quite a bit in putting some nice finishing touches on the pictures.-Screen Display – I like the size, it seems just about right at 4 inches. Whilst it is not a super amazing display it is still a very nice screen. The screen is also quite sensitive and I can see why Nokia claims you can use this phone with gloves on your hands during winter months.-Great storage options – 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card. I have a 16GB card installed so have 24GB total available on the phone. I cannot imagine getting a 24GB phone for about $110 from any other manufacturer.-Speaker – the quality of sound and the output level are amazing. The Nexus 4 speaker is downright pathetic in comparison.-No flash on camera – This is one minor irritant but not that big a deal. It takes reasonable pictures and then I can always process them later if I really like the low light picture. On other low cost devices there might be a flash but the actual camera and camera software is lousy and so the actual pictures are not that much superior anyways. I offer up two examples – Nexus4 and Samsung Galaxy Exhibit II – my two Android phones and of course the iPad2 has a horrible camera as well.-WP Ecosystem – This is a slightly weak spot in the overall experience. So far I am missing one music app (but the equivalent is actually just as good), Google Currents, a slightly better mobile  browser, and Vonage Extensions on the Lumia 521. I am not an Instagram user so that is not a deal breaker for me. The ability to sync my work and personal calendar and to have three live tiles – one for work email, one for Gmail and one for Hotmail on the home screen are huge advantages for me. Nokia Music, Nokia Maps are really good apps to use as well. The ability to sync files via the laptop and a USB cable is also quite convenient.In conclusion, if you're looking to try out WP8 or get a back-up smartphone for your $350 to $750 smartphone (Nexus to iPhone and everything in between) let me help you cut your chase short. Buy this phone for $99 on Amazon or Microsoft store for T-Mobile or Metro PCS or Straight Talk. You can even buy the Lumia 520 for the same price if you are a big fan of AT&T;/Aio or have a Straight Talk AT&T; compatible SIM card.At this price point I don’t think there is an Android phone that can hold up to the performance of the Lumia 521/520. And Nokia is planning to roll out the WP8 GDR3 as Nokia Black update pretty soon so that makes this a really good phone with up to date hardware and an up to date OS for a price that is as good as a souped up feature phone. $99 Android phones running 4.4 Kitkat are still quite a ways away:-)
+	My husband and I are 68 years old and have used feature phones exclusively. I just wasn't interested in high priced, expensive contract smartphones and I make all the tech decisions in our household.  When my husband started wishing he had a smartphone, I began to read all the tech news on the phones and systems in mid-2012.  I have always been a Windows user and did not want to change to Apple.  I admire Google but realized that really tech savvy people were using it.  When Windows 8 came out, I decided I would start by buying a Windows 8 tablet, get used to the system, change my computers to the Win 8 operating system, and then buy us phones.  However, I wanted to wait for an inexpensive Win 8 phone with no contract. I bought the tablet in November 2012, changed my computer operating systems to Win 8 in March 2013. At that time the tech news started talking about the coming inexpensive Nokia Lumia 521 on T-Mobile with no contract.We bought our phones on the first day they were available at T-Mobile in May.  We have used them for a month now.  T-Mobile was very helpful getting our numbers from our old no-contract carrier, which was difficult - their staff at the Pleasanton store is to be commended.I had already changed to Microsoft Outlook on the web to get ready for my tablet, computer, phone plan.  All my addresses, phone numbers, friends and family were ready and waiting and available to my phone. I had set up an Outlook account for my husband but hadn't put in his addresses and such, so I did have to do that. I was extremely pleased that I could just do it comfortably on my computer and populate his phone. I just shared my calendar with him.  I have had to teach him how to use the phone but he was eager and ready to learn, and it isn't a difficult phone to use.  He isn't very interested in tech usually.  On his first weekend out, he took wonderful photos at a wedding that the bride's parents loved.This is growing too long, but if you are a new smartphone user and want to control your phone costs, try this phone.  The features that I love are WiFi calling, Here Maps, the high contrast screen, great sound, good size for small hands and the integration with Outlook and social media. It has all the apps we need now, probably because we aren't power users, and more are being added all the time.Give this phone a try, it is really nice and easy to use.
+	I got this here on amazon and so far this is my best product that I bought from amazon. It's wonderful piece. Supports 4G, video and picture quality is good for the price. Audio is okay. I did not play much with the audio, but the few times I played music i felt good. Touch is smooth, not sure which type of touch technology it works with(it's not the resistive touch so the other one), but it's cool. Facebook app is not that good, but its acceptable. For a windows phones with that price is just awesome. I would suggest it for some who wants to try the windows phone..
+	If you want a good phone for a great price this is it. Has all the apps any more expensive phone would have.
-	Shipping was on time and when first opened the phone seemed fine.  After I activated the phone I tryed to remove the plastic packing film that comes on the scfeens of all "new" phones, when I did that the hole front screen came off with it.  Also the USB cable used for chraging was bent so I would have to bend it just to get a charge. It seemed to me that this phone was not NEW as advertised but REFURBISHED. Im very upset and stuck.
-	It does have much memory and what you download can not go on a memory chip.  You need a phone that can download features and you would not have any complications.
+	I love the look and the feel of this phone. It did however take some time in getting use to it but now  I am happy that I bought it . The price was great also . the  phone has  some awesome features like  a voice mail read out  so you don't have to actually log in to the  voice mail to see the message. The sound on the phone is nice and loud when it needs to be. The one down side that  I can find is the USB charging cord that came with the phone the cord is only about 3 inches long so trying to plug it in to a computer can be tricky if you have high USB slots.
-	The dual SIM is a blessing when you have perfect communication all the time. This phone is really a 'wannabee', it has the looks of a great phone but it sucks! You have to walk and turn around for people to hear you without cracking or robotic sounds. The internet feature is a scam, it takes 10 minutes to go online and another 10 minutes to open an email, forget about surfing the net. It has these 'group divisions' (family, work,etc) to store phone numbers but it doesn't work. It doesn't have settings to send your sms messages to the memory card which has a greater capacity for storage, it sends them to the mini phone memory. Video and music have not mp3 or mp4 or any other 'normal' file extension, you have to convert them first the the weird phone's file extension. I wouldn't even give this 'imposter'to my kid, it would be pure torture.
+	Does everything well, call quality is amazingly clear, camera okay . The navigation is absolutely excellent. And if I wreck it, a new one is $89. Can't beat it!
+	I'M AN ANDROID USER, BUT NEEDED A ECONOMICAL SECOND PHONE; I STUMBLED INTO THIS ONE ON SALE AND LOVED IT!!!! VERY POWERFULL & USER FRIENDLY!!!
+	I moved from an Android phone. The reason for my move was email. Email on android has massive problems. Deletes don't propogate to server and are duplicated on the phone. I had to manually delete trash items one by one every week. It was tiresome. And if I was offline, GPS was done for.I love my Nokia. Outlook is rock solid. GPS offline - no problem. Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has. Oh well. It has everything I "need".
-	I got this as a replacement phone. Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work. T mobile tech support is a joke. The level of costumer care is about on par as going to a witch Dr to fix a broken toe. If you do decide to go with those you will end up paying more just to get it turned on assuming you have the few weeks needed for t mobile to not only help you but for all the times you end up spending it back and forth a few dozen times.
+	all the bells and whistles without the high price tag. Good starter phone for teens. works with t-mobile, so saves money there too.
+	this phone is awesome.. i bought it for my husband, and he has never had a smartphone. it is holding up good. once he learnt how to operate it, he loves it. everything on it works good. i love a windows phone..
+	I bought 2 for my kids and they love them. They are able to do all the things the expensive phones do at a fraction of the price. Plus I won't cry if the break or lose them.
+	I have had every platform now... Android, Apple, now Windows 8. Always was a die hard samsung fan and bought three different galaxies over the span of two years and also two iPhones before that. This phone beats them all! Fast, affordable, easy to navigate, lots of great features. I am utterly shocked by how much I like this phone!
+	I love my windows 8 its the best , its faster than iphone and android! I bought mine thru tmobile which cost 126.00 for each phone , we have a family plan with unlimited everything for 120.00 only. The only thing that doesnt have on this phone is candy crush and meetme but who cares I can live without it on my phone because I have it on my tab 2! And another is the battery life is great it last about 2-3 days if u barely use it. And if its on stand by around 16 days. And the camera  is also great even thou it doesnt have a front camera and flash !Thank god I made the right decision to get this phone :) to everyone if you wanna switch to tmobile they will pay your early termination fee from ur carrier.
+	I bought this for my teen who really wanted an I Phone but that wasn't in our budget. He loves it. It is a windows 8 phone and does a lot. To see exactly what it does, I recommend you to go on youtube and watch a review on it. That's what we did.
-	This phone never connect in 3G network never appears in up bar the sign "H" is a 2G phone, I don't understand.
-	Don't be suckered into buying Windows Phone, the cheap price and decent technical specs will fool you into thinking this phone offers the complete smartphone experience. My major deal-breaker with this phone is that each app has its own unchangeable settings for read/writing to the sd card, which means that 9 times out of 10 you will be FORCED to save to the 4gb phone memory. Not to mention the lack of apps in the first place, so even if you are displeased with the performance of one app you are S*** OUT OF LUCK to find a more comprehensive app.
+	Got rid of my old 8 yr old cell phone and moved into the modern world. This phone fits more than fits my needs.Great product.
-	IF I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS, I WOULD. I HAD READ OTHER REVIEWS AND WAS AWARE THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE GETTING THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE SELLER, THEY HAD A HIGH RATING AND THE PACKAGE SHIPPED OUT OF MESQUITE, NEAR DALLAS TEXAS. SO I ORDERED THE PHONE. HOWEVER, THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL BEING SOLD IN THE US. I THOUGHT I WAS BEING CAREFUL BY SELECTING A COMPANY THAT HAD USA IN THE NAME (BLUTEKUSA).WHEN THE PHONE ARRIVED, THERE WAS AN ADAPTER FOR THE US AND THE SEALS WERE SLICED. WHEN I OPENED IT, THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE IN SPANISH AND THE ORIGINAL PLUG WAS ONE OF THOSE INTERNATIONAL PLUGS WITH THE WEIRD CYLINDRICAL RODS. NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!FORTUNATELY, AMAZON HAS A RELATIVELY HASSLE FREE RETURN POLICY. MAYBE THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FALSE ADVERTISING ON THIS PAGE...
-	This goes to all buyers.barely a week the phone develop a fault. when I return it for refund I was charged a restocking  fee of 50%. just because they claim I didn't include a sim card that came with the phone. very surprise!!!!!!
-	The phone I got form you the galaxy note 2 came in the mail. it was missing the stylus that goes In the back and when I put my sim card in it did not work I was told by Tmobile that the phone was reported stolen I gave the local police and the FBI your information and address they told me that sadly this is a scam that's going on. See you in court oh ya I am pressing charges and I will be suing for my money and then some.
-	Please be aware that the PC Suite software that comes with the Breeze III does not work with Windows 8. The USB driver is incompatible with Windows 8 (even when run in compatibility mode!)  Pantech customer service is aware of this, but says a driver or software patch will not be available for months -- possibly not until 2014!You simply cannot connect your Breeze III by USB to your Windows 8 PC to download pictures or interact with your PC in anyway.  You can install the software, but it will not connect to your phone when you connect your phone by USB cable.  There's no mention of this on their website (yet).I spent three days trying to figure out how to connect my Breeze III to no avail, and I consider myself fairly tech-savvy. I finally gave up and called customer service.  They knew instantly what was wrong with my phone. They were very nice and very apologetic, but they have no solutions and they don't expect to have a fix any time in the near future.This was an extremely frustrating experience for me. I've never had a tech company tell me that they had no solutions, no workarounds of any kind to offer me. And I cannot believe they haven't posted this vital piece of information on their website. It's not mentioned in their FAQ or in their troubleshooting materials anywhere.I don't know if this is just limited to the Breeze III or to all Pantech phones. But buyer beware: Pantech did not convey to me any sense of urgency or desire to resolve this problem for their customers.
-	Received the phone and the volume was extremely low, then could download any apps.its a nice phone but need more work!!
+	This phone has very few features for a smart phone and has them all on the front. This is the perfect smart phone for mom.
-	Phone would not charge after 1 month use; only after waiting 3 weeks to receive it. Horrible phone and service. I would not recommend this phone. Save yourself the headache.
-	My phone break badly after falling from just 1 1/2 feet height. Its screen is totally breakable with a small shock. Gorilla glass won't protect. Gorilla Glass 2 is just a marketing gimmick, it is just as regular glass. I used a slim case with Samsung that didn't protect at all.All features are good. FAST and EXCELLENT.No Protection available from Samsung like apple care. Now I am worried to have this phone.Those who already have this phone please buy insurance or add a bulky beauty killing cases. No I have to find another phone..
-	Wanted it for a back up phone. Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
-	I recieved this phone brand new took it out of the box it came in, it has a huge scratch down the screen and did not come with a charger or anything.
-	at first the phone was highly recommended for others to buy, not so much anymore. bought the phone in the beginning of December, it is now the middle of april and my phone ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT WORK. out of no where. at first it would turn on and off by itself without me being able to make a simple phone call. now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging. and just my luck I cant return it because its past jan 31st. hopefully this will prevent someone from making the same mistake I did
-	Ordered used, but only used for 1 week in perfect shape. It looked good but would not read the SIM cad installed at the ATT store. Installed a second SIM card and still would not read it. The same SIM card put into another phone worked fine. Also, was not happy with the communications with the vendor.I have since replaced it with an identical phone bought on EBay......vendor had great communications and I absolutely LOVE the phone.
+	We got this as a pre Christmas deal replacement phone for one of our family members on our T-​mobile plan (a regular plan, not a prepaid one). All we had to do was pop in the included small (micro) Sim card, and contacted T-mobile to change that person's Sim card to the one included, which took about 3 min. Within an hour it was activated, and ready to go. It has a nice display, is fast, quiet and zips through the web. Excellent deal for what we paid ($50)  It's not top of the line, but it has plenty of bells and whistles, and the person who is using it, loves it. Great deal for a very nice phone.
-	This phone sucks a knock off iPhone please don't waste your time or money and it takes forever to receive.
-	You said this was UNLOCKED for ALL carriers!!! This is NOT true. Those who do not KNOW the difference between CDMA and GSM phones, buyer BEWARE. This will ONLY work w/AT&T;, T-Mobile, Boost. If you have SPRINT or VERIZON, it will NOT work.....
+	Love this phone, so much so I bought one for my daughter. For the price you can't go wrong. It has great game play,music,chatting...ect  so easy to use great phone.  Thanks
-	It loads to slow n im havin trouble sending pics I guess the storage space is small I dont like this phone
-	Bought mine about 6 months now, and as usual i left it charging overnight and one morning it was dead, later I've learned that this was SDS sudden death syndrome that affects galaxy note 2 and galaxy s3. Never happened anything like this before with any of my other cellphones (even samsung). Dont take my words as truth, just do some research in the web before purchasing this phone
+	In terms of price/performance this one is off the charts.  It completes nicely with phones costing 3x as much.  If you are looking for a high quality low price phone this is it. If this phone has weaknesses, I had to search hard to find them.  I will get to the cons in a minute but this is a well thought out well constructed phone.First off, I will say that I use an iPhone 4S as a business phone.  I am an IT professional and have used blackberry and droid phones and have touched many different devices so I have quite a bit of experience with what is out there.  While I like the iPhone ok, I wanted something different then everyone else and heard great things about the new Windows 8 phones and decided to give them a try.  I don't want to spend a bunch on a phone because I swap my phone out every year and have T-mobile's no contract family plan.  My old phone gets passed down to my kids.  My personal phone was a Sammy.  I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.  I used the Mango platform WP 7.5 and decided to try WP 8 and see if the hype is warranted.  Ok on to the pros and cons.Pros: 1) The Windows tiles look great compared to the very plain looking iPhone square icons. 2)The installed phone apps are much more useful to me then the pre-installed iPhone apps. 2)  The offline feature of the Nokia maps are very cool. 3) Most of the time I am near a WiFi connection so the Nokia phone makes it very easy to connect to WiFi and use only Wifi unless that is unavailable.  You can also use WiFi calling on the phone.  This can really help on keeping your bill down. 3)The device is small and easy to hold yet large enough to be useful.  I love the size of it.  The iPhone is a bit too wide for my taste. 4) Navigation on the phone is super easy. WP8 is far superior to IOS here.  It is a very easy phone to pick up and use out of the box. 5) When I connected the device to my Windows 7 computer, it recognized it right away and suggested the phone app to download and Windows got my phone hooked up to my computer very painlessly.  Going with all Windows certainly has an advantage here. 6) Price.  This is simply the best value out there.  There is no way you can get something even close to this capable phone for even twice the price. 7) easily connected to my Blue Tooth headset something my iPhone refused to do.  It easily connected to Wifi. It is just very simple to set up. 8) hooks up easily to the cloud to store files and backup your phone.  Skydrive is a big plus.  There phone backup utility is fantastic. 8) I like the music app much better than the one on the iPhone. 7) very snappy performanceCons: 1) Screen resolution isn't bad but could be better. 2) Speaker sound is better on the iPhone but again not bad. 3) Phone case is a bit plasticy. 4) Camera has no flash but not a big deal for me.Looks like Nokia and Microsoft have knocked it out of the park with this phone.  Sure there are better phones out there but at this price there is nothing.  It is hard to believe that Apple charges $600 for a phone that just isn't significantly better then this one.  No doubt to me that the hardware on the iPhone is superior but I can buy 4 of these of that same cost.  In terms of ease of use the iPhone has nothing over this one.  The iPhone has the best app collection out there but it has been around awhile.  I like being different in a world crowded with Sammy and Apple phones.  I would have given it a 5 star except that you can see how Nokia tried to shave costs to get the price down but in terms of value I would give this 6 stars.
-	Hi, my phone only works for one year, works very well , but few days ago the mother board broke, is call the Sudden Death Syndrome. So I spend a lot of money for one year of use ... Bad ... so bad ...
+	Unbelievable that such an awesome smartphone with low price!This is my first time using windows phone. There are indeed a few of limitations of function compared to IOS and Android. But these are just slight ones that won't affect the general use too much.To my surprise, with such a cheap price, the phone has awesome functions and apps that can totally satisfy my daily needs.
-	It sucked..bad phone. No good apps dont ever want to buy a window phone again the phone is not worth it.
-	This seller (worldwide distributors) is selling phones that are (NOT) compatable to the USA...I have been having problems from day 1 and I thought I being a new user did not understand the phone and how to use it properly but as time has gone by it's gotten worse and when i contacted the seller to tell them the issues they said it was past the 30days and to contact the manufacturer because the phone is still under there warranty and they will fix it no problem. Well I did contact them and they had me read the phone's codes and they said the phone is hard wired to (Africa) so it's not hard wired to USA and that it's not under warranty because the phone is not compatable to the US and it's only gonna get worse as time goes on because the up dates will cause the phone to go out of sinc....So with neither the seller* (worldwide distributors) or (Amazon) not wanting to take responsibility and don't want to fix my phone or get me a new one that's USA made and compatable I'm warning you to stay away from this company and not do business because they will not make this right I spent $635.00 for a phone that is absolutely not very functionable or adiquite to work right. I't so frustrating that I'm gonna have to pay for another phone out of my pocket when they should fix this at it's not right f this company to sell inferior products and not USA comatable.
-	I cant believe amazon would allow a company like that to be a part of there service .the phone had 1g and a half .suppose to be 4g.i had to switch back to my old phone.horrible the worst dollar store phone.amazon probably will not give me satisfaction im sure
+	Bought for 18 year old "man child" who is tech savvy. He loves it! Excellent quality, excellent price, all features are as described. Phone takes great pictures, has good battery life, easy operation with sensible touch screen navigation. If you're low on your data plan, picks up wifi and runs well with it (no extra charge as w/ all t-mobile phones). Apps download quickly, good sound/voice quality. Definitely recommend.
-	These unlocked international phones are no good I wish I would have read all the reviews before I bought the Galaxy Note 2 GT N7100 I used it for a hr it moves slow every app you open all of a sudden just crashes I emailed the seller concerning a refund she replies back that they will keep 20% of what I paid for the phone which I think is unfair I received a bogus device,,, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE!!!
+	On Tmobile, they didn't force me to change my plan, and let me keep my prepaid plan.  On the phone itself, you can turn off data.  But it still has wifi.  So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.  Fine with me.  Would give it five stars, but the Windows App market is far behind.  Don't really care about apps that much except Twitter, and it works like a charm.  Great price too!
-	There is only 503 megabytes of internal storage for apps app data and media content! sd card size does not matter by the 5th app you download you will get the non stop phone storage is running low warning and wont be able to install most apps without deleting things.Down below it claims there is 2GB of phone storage and none of it is used. Its simply a lie this phone is cheap for a reason and it had so much potential.I think I deserve a full refund and extra credit towards a phone that has practical usable storage space such as 8,16, or 32 GB. I like the company because of their price range and it works fine except that one huge flaw!Please this is my first review tell me how I can go about getting a phone for similar price with REAL storage! or contact the company.
+	Brought the Nokia Lumia 521, It arrived within 3 days. It was sealed in the box, brand new. This is only forT-Mobile. THIS PHONE IS LOCKED TO T-MOBILE AND WILL ONLY FUNCTION ON T-MOBILE'S NETWORK. When T-mobile first turned it on, I couldn't get on the Wi-Fi. After 45 min. they decided to wipe the phone off, and then it worked. This is the second day and so far it's still online. I will have to wait and see if there are any other issues. It comes with angry birds already uploaded. It comes with the charger for the wall and a usb cord for your computer along with a card so you won't have to pay for one for your phone. T-mobile offers this phone for 125.00. This was a good deal.
-	This phone HTC Windows phone GSm it has apps how can I find the apps what section on the phone should I go on
+	i like it it is very good  thanks. i am thinking to get more for my family and friends.my be i will order 3 more
+	It's great. Having had only Android phones before, I didn't know if I'd like a Windows phone, but I do. The Lumia 521 is easy to use, fast, and reliable.  It's a keeper. I highly recommend it.
+	I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho. most people are right handed. it keeps getting triggered.
-	I have attempted to buy this item twice now each time after I buy it I check the following day after i'm done with my duties on base and only be annoyed to see that they have removed it from my list after I bought it and raised the price, originally I believe the phone was about 170 now its 230. All this seller wants to do is work you over, don't buy from him I just ended up going through somebody else for this phone.
-	i like the phone recommendations when i purchased it but after rece,d it i cannot get any support for activation. nextel is not in service and other carrier do not support this phone.this item should be remove for purchasing as a diskcontinue item.an replacement phone would be nice.
-	No good, when someone call me sounds like your in a tunnel. the phone just looks good. rethink buying it.
+	I picked up a 521 because of the price and curiosity. FYI it uses a micro sim.  I run mine on Simple Mobile 4G. What's nice are overall size and feel, fits nice in the hand. Functions are smooth but not very fast. The spoiler here is my other phone is 4G LTE.  I had an wifi only update which was painfully slow which is typical Microsoft.Overall I like it, will keep it for a backup phone and an occasional break from android.
+	El teléfono es elegante, liviano, es pantalla táctil, colores nítidos, pero lamentablemente no lo puede activar en Ecuador es CDMA PERO NO ES DESBLOQUEADO.
-	Bought for a Lumia phone which was returned as it did not meet my expectations It would probably be OK.
-	I returned it and I should have my money back. The phone simply did not work! The keys pressed were printing wrong. The screen was distorted. Major hassle returning and still have not received a refund.
+	Are you on T-Mobile and stuck with a Windows Phone 7 device?  Do you want to move to Windows Phone 8.1 without being stuck in a two-year plan?  This is the phone for you.For less than what I can get a Windows Phone 8.1 device on Craigslist, I can have a brand-new Lumia 521.  In fact, because I'm on a five-line family plan, I can have everyone on my plan upgraded to Windows 8.1.Now, $80 a phone is not insignificant a sum.  However, I find that being able to be free of multi-year contracts is worth it.  How about you?
-	I will never buy another Samsung product. This couldn't be worse.  I dial the phone and put it to my head, my cheek hits the buttons, and I have to use speaker. I DON'T WANT TO USE SPEAKER!  It doesn't have a timer, I have to download an app.  The volume for calls isn't high enough, no matter what I set it on. I can't hear it unless it's in the same room next to me.
-	I do not recommend it came with bad cell camera is not reliable so do not buy him find another seller
-	What were they thinking??Nice Phone, but ONLY 500MB available on phone for Applications (NOT 4GB).The internal drive is factory partitioned to only allow 500MB for apps! (Other BLU phones in this price range that I have encountered usually have at least 1GB available).This is a paltry amount of available memory for an android phone. I only realized it on the phone when I ran out of space to install apps the first day I had it, and then called BLU support, who verified it, because it was hard to believe. Not half as much as other similar BLU phones I have encountered. Amazing because it has very few Bloatware factory unremovable apps on board.Apparently BLU engineering designated other RAM memory just for photos and the like.  Why would the do this?  Couldn't get my all my needs apps to fit!!!Other BLU phone in this price range have at least 1.0GB available - and that is also paltry, but manageable for many people for whom I set these phones up.There are  definitely other Blu phones with more memory available and on paper the specs look the same, but again:The ONLY to find out before you buy it seems to be to call BLU Support first. They admit that these are unpublished specs. (As of May 2014)
+	I bought this phone as a gift.  It's really a great deal... since T-Mobile purchased MetroPCS they are now selling the T-Mobile network (not the older MetroPCS network) for less than T-Mobile is... you can get this phone for $99 (no rebate) with no contract and unlimited everything for $60/month.
-	can't get a contract phone so i was very excited to get it but the guy at the store said it has a contract , what a piece if crap
+	In terms of features and construction quality per dollar, you can't do better than the Lumia 520/521. After using mine for a while my wife replaced her Android phone with this as well!PROS: The phone is always fast and responsive -- never had any problems with lagging or crashing. The interfaces are intuitive and, to me, easier to navigate than both iOS and Android. With SkyDrive (ahem, OneDrive) integration and built-in Office this is a natural extension of my work computer. The camera is surprisingly high-quality for such a cheap phone. Has a microSD slot, so for $30 or so extra you can make this a 64GB MP3 player.CONS: Doesn't have a flash, so it won't replace your DSLR anytime soon. The biggest drawback is the Windows Phone App Store ecosystem. With iOS and Android, there's pretty much a variety of apps for any possible function you can imagine. Not so, here. My needs are pretty basic (facebook/twitter, evernote, RSS reader, weather app) so I'm covered, but you won't find a lot of games  or trendy new apps. I think this will change over time as Windows Phone is growing much more popular worldwide, due in large part to quality phones like this.The bottom line: if you're okay with the app selection, this is a remarkably high-quality phone that also happens to be one of the cheapest on the market. You have to go into the $200+ range to get an Android phone of similar quality. Highly recommended.
-	Didn't get to use it, carrier wouldn't activate it,sent it back the next day.So there's no way I can rate it.
-	This is the "international version". It came programmed in German, which wasn't too hard to change, but the plug does not work in US outlets.  I'd rather pay the extra hundred bucks and get one from the store ready to go.Also, the one I received had been opened and the seller was very upset I gave it a negative review.  They contacted me and tried to bully me into changing it.
+	I bought this from Walmart for my father in law.  Its great to see Amazon offering it now since its been tough to get at Walmart.What do you get for such a low price?Runs WP8 just as smooth as any of the high end phones.Fits great in your pocket and feels great in the hand.  For people that don't want a 5inch superphone, this size may be perfect for them.Runs all of the Nokia exclusive apps like Drive, Maps, Music, etc...Battery life seems to last a very long time and its removable in case you want to carry and extra one.What are the drawbacks?Only 8GB of internal memory:  But you have the option to include an SD card which can store your maps and media.No camera flash:  However the pictures are surprisingly good for a 5mp camera.  Easily beats out my old Focus and maybe even Lumia 900.No Front Facing Camera:  That could be a deal breaker for some.  Personally, I've found that I never actually use my FFC.No NFC (the tap to send thing):  Again, I've found I never use it.  Well I used it once on my 920 to transfer a picture just to try it out.512MB of RAM:  There are some games on the platform that require 1GB of RAM.  However most games work with 512MB and I can't think of any non-game apps that require 1GB.Screen:  While I think the resolution works just fine on a 4inch screen, there is no denying that the LCD looks cheap when put next to the ClearBlack display of a Lumia 920.No LTE:  For me this is probably the biggest drawback.  But you still get "4G" HSPA+.Summary:If you want to save money, this phone paired with no contract T-Mobile plans, is a great choice.  Just compare spending $200 on an iPhone to lock yourself into a 2year contract at $80-100+ a month.  Or you can get this for $130-150 and paired with $50 T-Mobile plan, or even the $30 Unlimited Data/Text plan offered through Walmart.  You could be talking thousands of dollars over a 2 year period.  Seriously, this phone does 99% what high end smartphones do for 30% the cost.
+	Hey whoever have plans to buy a phone I'd say go for this !! da best among peers.....simply the best...
-	at first this phone looks great but it really is not the internal storage just sucks and now i only had it for a little while and it is not letting me get on any apps it says low memory DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE
-	I ordered the iphone 4 and it said clean ESN but when I received the phone it already had a number. I could call and text from this person's number that wasn't even mine. I sent the phone back over a month ago and still have not received a refund! Don't waste your time.
-	I thought I was smart when I left Verizon for Straight Talk. The idea of no contract seemed good at first. Boy, was I ever wrong. I initially had a Galaxy Proclaim. It was so-so. The Proclaim began having battery issues after about 9-10 months and I purchased a Centra. It just does crazy things and is unpredictible. Horrible! The only thing worse than the phone is the service from Straight Talk.I will be going back to Verizon ASAP.I'm planning on getting a Motorola Droid Maxx.
-	Fades out, poor wifi, and phone carrier wifi, blanked out could not work two days straight..... Gave it to my six year old to play with waste of $86+dollars web kept sending some kind of Chinese lettering
-	Unsatisfactory productThe product does not comply with the following:The USB cable plug does not matchThe user manual does not belong to the phone modelThe user's CD is damage
+	This phone gives the best performance to dollar ratio, by far.With price point less than one hundred dollars, I don't mind not having as much customization/apps as a $500 phone.Skype works perfectly (you need to install it), WiFi calling is a breeze (ready to use), office documents can be edited, and most importantly the phone gets regular software updates.The battery life is better than most phones around.Camera is decent (nothing exceptional) but is very capable thanks to ISO setting option (not common for most phones).
+	i want to get this phone and than i dont because of all the bad reviews i see about this phone
+	The Nokia Lumia 521 is my first smartphone, although I am more than familiar with electronics hardware and software in general, and I keep up with the latest tech. Things like phones play a distant second fiddle to my interest in laptops and other computing devices. As far as phones and some other things go, I tend to wait until prices plummet when they become common.But, what a great phone to kick off my transition to a smartphone.  I could've bought an obsolete version of an IOS or Android device for more money than this. I'm simply floored by the quality of the Lumia paired with Windows Phone 8. I have to say, WP8 makes IOS7 and Android look obsolete immediately. But this review is about the Nokia, not Windows, and when comparing processing power and storage to other phones in this price range, it's not even close. Nokia has blown the whole smartphone market open with this thing.Build quality is very good, considering the price. The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery. Yes, this is a $100 phone that has expandable storage, with a more-than-ample 8gb already on the phone. And, the back plate is replaceable if you damage it or want another color. It's plastic, but like another reviewer commented, Nokia knows a thing or two about durability. They owned the market years ago with durability and quality. They don't fall short of that now, either.Paired with the 1 ghz dual-core Snapdragon processor, Windows Phone 8 behaves beautifully with no noticeable lag. The OS feels light and snappy on this phone, and transitions smoothly.What Nokia has done here has changed the whole way to approach first-time or budget smartphone buyers. You no longer have to settle for a distantly inferior phone with less money.  Nokia manages to shave off things like a camera flash, screen-side camera, HD screen and metal construction, and left high quality essentials and good hardware. It doesn't try to be everything - it clearly targets people who can settle for less options (although there are plenty) but want a good phone for what it does. To me, it does just that, and far more. Excellent product.
-	I ordered this phone through a third party here on Amazon called "Yellow Deals" and they shipped this phone to me pretty quickly. Communication with them was excellent and I have no complaints with them whatsoever.After owning several Windows OS phones and an Apple device, I decided to try my first Android device after reading how people swore by them. The LG P500 was my first android powered device and I took a chance knowing it ran on a meager 2.2 OS. I opened the box, charged the phone and then decided to begin exploring the phone.  Within 15 min. of exploration, I noticed that the touch screen lagged a bit and did not recognize the sd card slot at all. Now this was a total bomber because the internal memory on this phone is horrible and you would need external memory in order to download all of the excellent android apps that exist. After doing research I learned which apps I wanted to download and know that they would need tons of space to run properly.  I tried everything but nothing worked. I removed the card and replaced it several times but nothing worked.  First I thought the sd card that was shipped with the phone was faulty, so I gave the phone the benefit of the doubt. So I tried a spanking new 32 gig sd card and the phone didn't recognize that sd card either.  I knew I had to ship this phone back the next day. I was so disappointed. I then contacted "Yellow Deals", who got back to me right away.  I packed the phone back up and went through the process of returning the item.  I contacted Amazon - who also got back to me right away, and emailed me further instructions for shipping back the item.  I emailed Yellow Deals the delivery confirmation # and they issued me a full refund while the phone was still in transit to them. Now tell me, how COOL IS THAT?I thought of getting a replacement, but it was a good thing the seller didn't have any more in stock. I read on several sites that the 2.2 OS was upgradeable to 2.3, but when I downloaded the LG software update tool it stated that the phone already had the latest firmware. Another bomber! This phone is old by android standards and wasn't going to get anymore upgrades for it. I'm not experienced enough to jump through hoops with this phone. This is also not a US branded phone and therefore have no real warranty attached to it in the US if something goes wrong months later.  Another commenter said when his phone failed he learned the phone was covered by warranty in another country and it wasn't worth the hassle. So if this is correct, I dodged a huge bullet.Even though I wasn't able to get any use from this phone, Yellow Deals made this experience totally stress free. I haven't given up on getting my first android and after doing more research, my next phone will have a 2.3(Gingerbread) minimum operating system that will be upgradeable to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I learned that many Ericsson phones have 2.3 OS and an easy update to 4.0. I plan to use the refunded money to apply towards a better phone with a better and faster OS.Please use my experience with this phone to at least start your first android experience with a better phone than this one. Spend a few extra bucks and save the stress.  When your sd card slot fails, you are basically stuck with a slow lemon, pathetic 2.2 OS and finding yourself deleting your important apps in order to perform simple functions.
-	I do not recommend this to anybody I got this trying to save a few bucks and as the old saying goes.... I got what I paid for!!!! The phone doesn't even ring anymore when someone calls, just goes straight to voice mail. When I make a call all they can hear is static. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!
+	My nokia 710 gave up due to some HW problems and I decided to give a try to another win phone.I was surprised with Lumia 521 phone!Pros:1) I really appreciate Win 8 (much much better in comparison with 7.5 (I tired from zune!!))2) A little bit bigger screen improves interaction (feel that you have more real estate even though resolution is the same like 710 has)3) Faster4) It costs only 97$ (I got it from frys)!!What could be better:1) It looks like nokia 710 have better glass (better quality than 521)2) when you hold 521 in hand it feels a cheaper in comparison with 710.Overall I am glad that I got nokia 521. For money you could not get wrong with this phone!
-	It sucks. Do not buy!! Its not worth the money and it doesn't come with the stuff it said it did its a tip off!!
-	Bought this phone, and did not receive what I purchased. I was hoping to get a factory unlocked phone, and instead I got an Orange carrier phone which I cannot use in my country.I now have to return my phone, get a refund and start the process all over again.
-	The Note II is a fantastic phone, hands down. Sadly, though, it has one severe fatal flaw: the front glass is tremendously fragile.I purchased my Note II during the 2012 holidays. A few weeks ago, I dropped it and the front glass completely shattered. Having never broken a phone after dropping it, I was surprised and disappointed--I've dropped previous phones before from higher heights than 2.5 feet and they survived unscathed. I chalked it up to bad luck, and Asurion sent me a new one after I paid my deductible.Yesterday, I dropped my replacement, again, from a height of roughly two feet. Again, the front glass completely shattered.Once, okay, I can grudgingly deal with that. But -twice?- Inside two weeks? That's no longer a coincidence. That's a design defect. The front glass needs to be made a lot more robust.Since I only have one more insurance claim left, I've got a decision to make--replace the phone or replace the front glass myself. Both choices are equally daunting; YouTube is rife with videos on how to replace the front glass of the Note II and the Galaxy S III.Whatever the outcome, though, the phone is definitely going into an OtterBox afterward.
+	I had to return the first Lumia 521 phone I received because the touch wouldn't work sometimes, but I was sent the return postage and received my new phone quickly. The second phone had to have a hard reset, but now it's great. I love it!  The sound quality is wonderful, the apps are great and the camera is magnificent!  The phone does not have a flash, but even if you take pictures in low light the camera will lighten the photo to make a great picture. Of course, outdoor photos are really great.  I have no complaints about this phone.  My daughter bought one and recommended it to me and now I bought another daughter one for Christmas.  We are all very pleased with the phones and don't know how we made it without them before!
-	I'm seriously disgusted . Just three days and it doesn't work . I'm shocked very shocked . hum . .
-	It is not what it was descibed to be. Can't download apps or anything else on the DUD! My suggestion is not to sell the JUNK!
+	Despite the fact that the box says it's a prepaid phone, a regular T-Mobile sim card works just fine.  Call quality is comparable to the more expensive Android and iOS phones.  Great phone for those who just wants a phone to -- well -- make phone calls.
-	I hate this phone all head phones don't work and games are not good windows. Phone are not if you use to a android don't buy this phone wasted of money
-	This is not the product I thought I was getting. It IS NOT a 16 GB device, but rather 10GB. It came set up in Spanish and I suspect it was an inferior device intended for sale in Mexico. I am very disappointed in this purchase, and do not plan to buy electronics online in the future.Shame on you for misrepresenting this item
+	Free GPS and so easy to use. My aging father though it'd be harder to deal with a smartphoneBut since he figure out how to pin contacts and addresses to the home screen, he's having a blast.
-	The phone I received will only work on ATT Networks... I could not get my Verizon SIM card to work and neither could Verizon Tech Support.  The phone was set to recognize ATT networks only.  I had to return it.
-	The phone is a good sturdy phone but I'm very disappoint with how slow it runs. Freezes up trying to catch up.
+	Wi-Fi with this Lumina 521 works a greater distance than most other smart phones (and I have tested the Note 2 & 3, HTC, and LG phones).  I have had this phone for 1 month now, and to date have had no (zero) dropped calls with this device.  (Could be due to the phone, or the excellent T-Mobile network here...  maybe it is a combination of the two together...)Battery life is more than 24 hours with moderate use.  Windows phones OS is outstanding, and has never crashed.  I have restarted the phone only once, when I installed the micro SD card (you have to remove the battery ).Only drawbacks are: smaller screen size and no flash for the camera.  But, the long battery life, small handset size, and light weight properties overshadows these negatives and makes this phone outstanding.  Would recommend, especially for the current price of $99...  Better go ahead and order one while they are still making this model !!
+	im having such a great time with my new nokia fone ...  alot of great features and apps  , great camera captures  real  live pics amazing........
+	I'm very happy with this phone and service.  Compared to other phones we have (Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus, iPhone 4S) the quality is high and it is only lacking in features. No NFC, front camera, flash, or compass.  Everything else is there and works great. WP8 is smooth and snappy.  Read the other reviews, it is a really good phone.  Excellent even, when you look at how much more you'd pay for comparable phones.
-	I am disappointed :( I buy often from Amazon but  this product It will not work, every time I try to open a page it tells Me to force stop or to rebbot the phone and the Internet will not Open i have to wait at least 5 minutes before it opens and downloading apps makes it imposible due to the time you have to work the phone.....It Is a Bad Selection i do not Recomend this product to no one
+	It is a very good phone for the price but get it from Microsoft store for only $69 and save some money. Also buy a good, sturdy case as the phone is too slippery.
-	My husband got me one of these phones for christmas. I loved it when i got it, but a couple of weeks later i wish i would of never bought this phone. It is not a good phone at least i thought it was but false. I advise anyone do not buy this phone. Im having all kinds of problems with it.
+	The screen is not as nice as on the high end Lumia's ... but it is a great phone at a budget price!
+	wow love it!! the phone came before the due day that was awesome and it was well send because i order it as gift. good quality and it works awesome!! if i could give more stars i would give 100 stars. i so recommend this and would definitely be buying from this seller again.
+	This is my first window phone, shiping fast , when it out of the box,it looks beautiful, easy to set up, easy to use, the touchscreen is very good, download fast, speaker is very good, connect to wifi very fast, it has good good battery life.I like everything of this phone and good price
+	For this price this phone does everything. I'm not a supporter of apple products. $600 for a phone that's made in china is a rip off, but people will pay it which keeps the cost up.
+	I love it. It has everything I need being a first time smartphone user myonly problem was accessing the tv-mobile with tmobile other than that I love the phoneand yes I would recommend this phone and I also love the price
+	Phone is works great & love the fact we saved 50.00 verse paying T-MobilePayment plan of 120.00. Easy to use and set up. Doesn't come with Micro SD card recommend you get a 8GB or higher based on all phone picture capability 5mp and music options. The 4 inch touch screen very easy. If you have kids who beat up their phones or go through phone due to abuse this is a great option. Do recommend a good case cover & screen protectors...  Would buy another one and great phone for everyone.....
+	ill start with the good :)-light weight well proportioned,and smooth touch screen.-comes with a nice case and xtra battery-works great with tmobile and at@t in the usa.pop in sim and go!-looks expensive and very slim.-add your own micro sd card and storage isnt an issue.-great battery life. 6hrs of talk time..and days of standby.now the bad :(- specs listed by seller are wrong!  not a big deal concidering the price- but heres the Real specs:  arm cortex a5 single core 1ghz cpu  mali-300 graphics (not to bad)  218mb of system ram(not 512mb)  256mb of storage  (not 4 gig)  480×854 res. (240dpi) screen  2 point captive multi touch  wifi b-g/blutooth 2.1/ No GPS/2g edo data only/.  camera on back is actually 640×480( inteterpolated to 3mp  camera on front is actually 320×240  runs on android 2.3 - with a hacked skinmade to look like 4.1 os  no adobe flash installed! (but downloading flash was an easy fix tho)now...is this phone worth the price. YES!put a 16gig micro sd in it- download a different launcher (i used ftl launcher) -put a task killer on it ( i used super tool box) - and your good! its less than 100bucks ,looks good,can text -surf web-make calls(and the reception is actually pretty good) and the best part....runs emulators great!(i installed  epsxe.apk for playstion / gameboid.apk for gameboy advance/snes9xEx+.apk for super nintendo/and nds4droid.apk for DSi /and All ran perfectly! (i play ff7 on this!)you see,even tho this phone lacks memory and processing power of most smart fone..it has a Awsome graphics chip! the Mali-300 is incredible for console emulators. so its actually a good deal.i do wish the seller would list the Actual specs of this phone..but im happy with it and will buy more in the future.ps.the free wifi hotspot teather is really nice too! i actually wrote this review using it on my laptop for internet :)
+	SCREW SPRINT I was a sprint customer for 13yrs and we parted on bad terms so i see this phone for less than $100 dollars. so i bought it and added TMOBILE  to it,  prepaid service. I'm done with contracts and being robbed monthly. Man i should have done this years ago. great phone great service. happy happy!
+	I really love this device but my only concern is you cannot check your call log time. but its a good device
+	Five stars to a phone that is an entry-level W8 phone, but acts far more sophisticated in comparison to it's small price.  I paid $69 for this phone via HSN, and it is the second best item I've purchased (Acer c720-2848 is the first best). When I bought it, it was with the $50 unlimited everything.  But I realized I don't need to pay that much, so I found a way to change it to $30 w/100 min talk and unlimited text and internet.  This phone blows me away!It is smooth in scrolling and it opens applications fairly quickly.  It takes a few seconds to hit the internet, but that's no big deal. Music sounds loud and clear; screen is very good, given price.  I loaded some piano tutorial videos and they played well-- clear and sharp.I did have a problem with setting up wifi calling, but a late-night chat with an agent advised me that 911 was not setup. She did the setup and after I restarted the phone, I was able to make a wifi call.All-in-all, this is a great phone that should please most.  I would recommend this baby!
+	Background: I am not a techie, just a regular person. Previously owned the T-Mobile G2 for about 2 years. I was trying to decide between the Nokia Lumia 521 and the Samsung Galaxy Exhibit, and ended up getting the Exhibit due to familiarity of the Android system. After a few days, I bought the Nokia due to the touchscreen not being responsive.Nokia PROS:---The ability to uninstall pre-loaded apps you don't want!---Extremely customizable! I love playing with the different options.---High internal memory limit. I don't even think I need this 8gb micro-sd card anymore.---Really good battery life---Even though there's no flash, the pictures come out pretty clear and are automatically adjusted for light---Microsoft Office mobile!---Very responsive touchscreen, fast processing, and wonderful interface overall!Nokia CONS:---Having to switch to a micro-SIM card makes testing out different phones impossible---No option to turn off auto-rotate, which can be annoying if you lay in bed---No weekly view for the calendar---There is no backlight for the 3 controls (back, home, search) when using it at night, you just have to fumble around.---WINDOWS APP STORE! I am really a Google/Android fan. This is like a downgrade, but it's not the end of the world.I really like this phone, I just don't know if I can get with the Windows world.
-	I have been their customer for a while ( I should say almost 5 years). But since then their customer service has become hopeless. Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing. I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it. They have just gone down hill.Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features. But the processor is slow. I have to reboot it atleast once a day. If you have the phone , wife and gps on , most time it hangs. Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess. For e.g auto answer and setting # of rings etc. Not worth the price.
-	I purchased this blackberry 8120 for my wife. First of all they sent a wrong charger, but somehow I managed because I had a spare charger.Its just been a month and the phone is not working. Its turning off, without any reason.Its a mere wastage of money. Donot buy this mobile. Iam very disappointed. I need to return or either exchange this cell phone. Please help me out.
-	I like it but there is a problem when I text messages I attached pictures and when I try to send to another mobile I can't and I do not receive picture from another mobile. So what can do I do to receive and send Pictures with this mobile?ThanksYosief
+	Great phone price even better ! Does a lot, very fast, and easy to work I recommend this phone !
+	smaller than i thought but love the performance...it came on time..now my daughter wants one fror herself but wonts a differant color
+	I have had the phone for a few days now and so far so good ! I like learning the windows OS . Good value for the price . Someone mentioned that you could not record with the camera that is not true the phone does videos as well . The camera is not the greatest but for the price its just fine . I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for good value at a lower price .
+	Purchased this for my daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves it, and has been using it nonstop for the last couple of months. It has everything she wanted, which for an 18-year-old is sometimes difficult to find. We have had no problems with it freezing up or having to be reset or anything like that. Very pleased with this purchase.
+	I finally found an affordable smartphone. It works great. I also purchased the sim kit for $30 a month from Walmart. If you don't choose the $30 plan right away and you go thru T- mobile ($50/monthly) first you can't go back to the 30 dollar plan. For me that plan thru Walmart is perfect I don't use the phone that much for calling anyway (100min/monthly). As for the apps I don't use that many apps. I mostly text and surf the net. I noticed there were one or two apps I couldn't get but there was an alternative for it so I don't care. Overall I'm very happy with this phone.
+	very cheap,and worked fine for first couple months but started to fall apart,the back comes off,and it restarts by itself
+	This phone is very very fast.  It has always kept up with my abusive behavior of switching between 10 apps every minute.  The screen is big enough to enjoy watching movies on.  There is no better deal that I could find for the price.  It has 8 gigs internal memory!So here are the quirks:1.) Loose battery connection - The battery will slip out of place because the prongs are set a little too loose if it is shaken or shifted too quickly in your pocket.  This was super annoying as it turned my phone off several times a day.  I found out that many people had this problem.  To fix it, just wrap some paper around the battery to stick it in tight.2.) Limited apps and limited "messing with it" - This was a sad one for me because there is absolutely no way to explore the internal files on the phone.  Windows didn't build a file explorer into the system on purpose (security, hacks).  I hate not being able to get to the internal organs of my phone but I have to deal with it.  The apps are limited.  Companies make apps for iphones and androids and few make them for windows phones.3.) Many things don't save onto SD card - This is the very worst thing, in my opinion.  It only saves pictures, video, and music obtained the "proper" way.  If you install an app to search and download music beware.  It will save it to phone memory and there is no way to transfer it to the sd card!So, I just listed the bad things so you'll know, but the truth is I really like this phone.  It's internal memory is enough for all the apps I use and more.  It's FAST.  Startup time is less than 30 seconds.  Camera takes beautiful landscape pictures and has a great editing tool.  This phone is CHEAP for what you get.  1 Ghz processor with 512 mb ram.
+	There are so many pros to this phone I'm just going to list them off.- The main reason I purchased this phone was for the price.  You can't argue that it's not affordable.  When I purchased it it was just over $70 after taxes.- Easy to use Windows Phone interface.  This is a great phone for seniors or the less technically inept.  It takes a little bit of getting used to with the initial setup, but once you get used to it, it's very easy to navigate.  Much easier than an Android phone.- Quality was top-notch.  Screen does not scratch easily and surprisingly the white back cover does not pick up dirt as easily as I expected.- Battery life is surprisingly good for smartphone.  The phone goes two days or more for me, but I only make calls and texts.  I don't use any apps or games.Now, to the cons:- Screen brightness is not the greatest and viewing angles are fairly poor.  It's practically impossible to use outside.  I changed the color scheme to yellow so that I could make out the words and numbers on the screen.  If it had a half decent screen, I would give this 5 stars with no hesitation.  This is the only thing holding it back from 5 stars for me since I'm outside a lot.- Call quality isn't the greatest.  Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.  But, I guess that's expected for most smartphones.So, given that the pros outweigh the cons and that the price is the best on the market, you can't beat this phone.  If you want a simple, senior friendly, easy to use, and affordable beginner smart phone this is your best option.
+	I have ordered this phone. So far I haven't received it yet. It looks legit. But if straight talk does not work with it, let's just say I'll be getting my money back.
-	If you don't buy the card for pictures you WILL loose them all when they swap out the phone.  I only had the phone 4 months when the main screen when.  They would happily honored the warrantee but I all pictures would be lost.  There doesn't seem to be a way to save or retrieve the pictures.  I can't believe there isn't a way to get them back out w/o the main screen working. But that is what I have been told by both Motorola and Sprint.  I haven't given the phone up because the pictures I had were from a trip I waited 24 years to take. AND I'm holding out hope as I climb the chain of command.  It still works as a phone accept I can't add any new numbers or people to it.  Now it's been 6 more months and the hinge is broken too.  I'm going to go back to my old phone (i530) which still works after 5 years.  I only up graded because I decided it was time.  Boy, was I wrong.  Save yourself a headache and DO NOT BUY it.Renee B.
-	I continue to say the same thing over and over and over again; that is: "Please send me an unbroken, English Language, unlocked Samsung Galaxy S III I9300 phone". I've said this four times and I'm disgusted with this transaction. Please help me to obtain a good phone. You cannot possibly understand how disgusted I am with this entire transaction. It's the end of December and I started trying to get a satisfactory phone in November.A VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER,Ray Dorsett
-	The phone was getting stuck. It has no app store. The front and back camera it to dark. I can go on and on.!
-	ITS A GOOD PHONE BUT IT IS INTERNET LOCKED. I CANT USE IT OUTSIDE VERIZON COVERAGE OR WITH OTHER NETWORKS.
-	My battery  did not charge, couldnt get wifi connection anywhere or in the house?? Bad service especially in a house.
-	the fon dont work it was not wat i want i have to much trouble whit this fon i dont like
-	I loved my Proclaim but after almost a year the charging port stopped functioning. Straight talk replaced that phone with this one, the Centura, since the Proclaim was no longer available. It is MUCH slower than the Proclaim, that I could tell immediately. Also, from the very first day it would not correctly set the time. I am Eastern Time but clicking on that set it two hours ahead. I tried to set it manually but it would reset itself. I see others have had that same problem. I will be asking them to send me another phone. This is a REAL annoyance since I need it for my job. Straight talk is nice a cheap and I love being able to use Verizon towers - coverage is great - but cheaper service really is noticeable in the lousy customer service. If you can afford it, save yourself a headache and don't use Straight Talk. If this is all you can afford, be prepared to pull your hair out with slow service, people you can't understand and outright hang ups. No kidding!
-	Not a good phone garbage so mad a waste of money never again blue isn't a good brand buy a Samsung
+	It is a very fast cellphone. Its design is fantastic. Very reluable. Great sound and image.  Clear voice and perfect interphase
-	The phone doesn't turn on anymore after two weeks. When you turn it on it just go blank I will call amazon and get my money back
+	I switched from an older android phone and am impressed with the ease of use. I have been able to find most of my favourite apps in the windows store or something comparable and it has office built it. I use it a lot!I do not have T-Mobile in my home area yet, but I work where I get perfect call/data quality on their 4G network!!
-	Be warned. I found the hard way! Purchased $25 T-Mobile Refill Card a month ago. Tried to use it today, T-Mobile rep says the card is void. A call to Amazon rep and here is the response: Prepaid cards are non-returnable, non-replaceable, non-refundable. Amazon will take your money and has no obligation to show anything for it. Consider yourself warned. I am not buying any cards from Amazon again. Full me once, shame on you....
-	Going from an android to a windows phone is like going from today back into caveman times. Literally returned it the same day I got it.
+	Excellent phone at a low price, Windows OS is the best I"ve used, and the app store has plenty of stuff.  Buy it.
-	nice phone except it is not 4G, false advertised...I even emailed them asking if it was 4G to assure my decision on buying one, they told me yes it is, so don't be fooled it is not 4G...so giving the phone 1 star for B.S. lie
+	Windows may be limited still, but I am still stunned by all the things this phone can do and all for less than $100.  Best wifi calling I ever had.  Better cell antenna than any phone except ancient Nokias I had.  Lastly the camera works very well even though the phone does not have flash.  Thank you Nokia/Now Microsoft
+	This phone has the look and feel of the real samsung galaxy.  It is an international version so all the functions do not work. My S pen does not work and I am considering returning it for a new one but just dont want to wait the shipping time.  Other than that the delivery was about 3 weeks from China to Georgia. Once you get a tracking number I suggest you go to the USPS website to place tracking on the device so you can see its every move; even sign up for the email alerts.  I ordered this phone 6 days after I ordered the same one from another seller but this came first. Im still waiting on the first one which I will compare and do a review on later once it arrives. The dealer has been very nice answering any questions and concerns and said that I have a 2 year warranty.  As far as the S Pen, my coworker is buying a the real galaxy with her carrier and I am going to see if her S Pens works in mine so I can know if its just the S Pen or the phone.  Let me be clear, it works in the memo note etc but the menu does not open once I pull out the S Pen.  So I can live with that (I think). lol
+	For the price, it is a very good phone. I would recommend getting it.  All the needed features are available.
-	This phone appears to be a awesome phone. It definitely is not. It is the worst decision I have ever made as far as phone shopping. Blu's customer service is even worse than the product. I do want to say that I did not buy my phone from Amazon. There is a part in the phone called the proximity sensor. This is supposed to turn the screen off when the phone is near your face. If it doesn't work you will hit random buttons on the pone with your face. This is o of many things that sucked on this phone.Icon would move on their own from screen to screen. The camera is really bad. The picture quality was horrible and all the pictures came out blue. I reached out to customer service and through email for almost 7 weeks they just kept leading me no where. All I wanted was a new phone and this was with in one week of purchase. Anyway This problem never got resolved and I went and bought a used Samsung S3 for the same price. WAY BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Please don't fall for this. You really get what you pay for in this situation.
-	This was the worse thing I've ever purchased, first it didn't charge, then they sent me a replacement then the replacement wasn't any better, it didn't charge, didn't turn on. I was so disappointed because I've had very high standards for Nokia products
-	A fully charged battery lasted only 5 to l0 minutes. It also power down by itself.The product i ordered is not the product i received. I order a GSM and rseived a smart phone.
-	The phone that was described on e site was nothing at all like I was expecting. The delivery and packaging were he only good things about this phone. I had purchased this phone full retail price minus gift card and shipping hoping that I could use the factory unlocked phone on my cellular network. Wanted the option of not having to extend my contract and hopefully use the phone somewhere else if needed. I didn't know the phone could only be used internationally, at least that's what I was told when I took it up to Verizon hoping they could activate the phone for me. But there was no ESN number in the phone and SIM card would not register the phone. Do not buy unless you fully research this phone which was a mistake on my part. I will say I have purchased the note through Verizon and its one of the best phones out there, way better than the iPhone 5.
-	This product did not work. Not only did it not work with a major Canadian cell phone service provider (Bell Canada), it would not function properly even on a technical basis. I was lucky that the company provided me a full refund.
-	IF YOU WANT TO USE AT&T; SERVICE OR PREPAID GOPHONE, DONT BUY THIS OR THE 7105 AT ALL, BELOW ARE THE REASONS I FOUND OUT FROM RESEARCH AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM THE SELLER1. NO 4GLTE OR EVEN 4G WITH AT&T;, HAS SLOW DATA AND IS BEHIND IN NETWORK STRENGTH2. NO WARRANTY AT ALL, YOU BUY IT. IT STOPS WORKING THE NEXT DAY, YOUR S*** OUT OF LUCK3. ITS THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION WHICH MEANS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALLTHOSE REASONS ALONE CAUSED ME TO REQUEST A REFUND AND CANCEL ORDERIF YOU WANT THIS PHONE, TYPE INTO AMAZON SEARCH BOX, "ATT NOTE 2 i317". THAT PHONE IS THE 4G LTE VERSION AND IS THE US VERSION. HAS A WARRANTY AND IS ONLY $399 WITH FREE SHIPPING. YOU CAN ALSO USE WITH TMOBILE 4G. HOPE THIS HELPS THE BUYERS OF THIS PHONE, IT IS TRULY AMAZING IF YOU GET FROM THE RIGHT SOURCE.
+	I purchased this phone from a T-Mobile retail store for $150. You also have another option to pay $29.99+tax upfront, with the remaining $120 spread-out in $5/month installments for 24 months.  No need to pay $190+ for this phone from Amazon.I've been a Samsung/Android user for the past several years with various iterations of the Galaxy S phones.  I'm not a power user by any means, I use my smartphones for calls, texts, email, maps/navigation, light usage of games and light surfing of the web.  This phone is all I need to fit my needs.  The call quality is great, and the speaker sound is surprisingly sharp.I really enjoy Windows 8. The OS is very responsive, no 'Force Close' you get with the Android system. You can really customize the phone to your liking (from the size of the tiles, the arrangement, the color, etc.) I can pin specific people to the start screen for quick access to call or text.  Setting up email (both personal and work) was a breeze.  So much simpler than Android.If your looking for a basic smartphone, you cannot beat this value.
+	This Windows Phone is a fantastic device.  It's a media player (mp3, music, podcast, videos), a productivity device (Office, Reader), small computer (email, web browser) and a phone!  No flash on the camera or back lit buttons, but Nokia had to take something away to get to this price point.  And even so, it feels like a high end device.  The software is smooth and fast, you can get access to Xbox Music and Video, and there are 100s of thousands of apps in the store!  One more thing, even without the flash on the camera, it takes VERY good photos.
+	This phone is really nice for the price.  This is my first Windows phone and the fact I didn't have to mortgage my house to buy it was the first plus.  The phone does everything you need plus.  It feels good in your hand, takes great pictures, and is pretty fast.  I would recommend this phone to anyone who likes their money and wants quality.
+	Phone comes new in the box WITH A WALL CHARGER, A USB CABLE AND A SIM CARD. If you have an old SIM card you can just stick it in and go. Once three weeks ago it froze while switching incoming calls but since then no issues. Works great, Syncs with car and reads and writes what I say into text while I drive. Very nice phone. Always has signal and battery lasts a long time, more than a day with a reasonable amount of usage going on.
+	awesome phone for the price - it was on sale for 59.99.  I miss the android marketplace, but the features and the 8.1 update more than make up for it.
-	Dead dead dead.  A phone should not die after 7 weeks. Even for this price, you would expect a year.
-	When the phone arrived I took it to my local Verizon dealer and they set it up with no problems. I had no problems at all and my maintenance guy loves it.
-	this is the worst phone ever because you can't do anything on it,can't download facebook or any games,because the memory is to low,need to build in higher memory for selling this phone.Waisted my money on a gift for my daughter of 16 who badly use a phone for facebook,twitter and 1 game (hayday)
+	Nokia Lumia 521 from MetroPCS is the perfect solution for somebody who needs a small wifi device that can act like a phone as well!  This extremely affordable phone (edit: I see the price came down quite a bit in a month since I first posted this review) ($99 at MetroPCS) offers free data & calling over WiFi, for $40/month w/out any contracts. This is the best phone deal around (MetroPCS version). It is "just what you need" from a cell phone compact wifi device. Honestly, why would anybody pay $500+ for other phones AND also get stuck in a 2-year contract w/ the carrier? iphone isn't made of gold, is it?The more I use this phone the more I like it. This phone answers the needs of over 99.99% of cell phone users. Please don't tell me you want to pay $500 more for your phone because it comes with $2 headphones or FREE Google Maps. People with extravagant amount of disposable income should not waste time considering Nokia Lumia 521, for everybody else, this is IT.
-	I purchased two smartphones as gifts for India. One worked and the other didn't. It was embarrassing to give a gift that doesn't work.
-	my cell phone died unexpectedly and I needed a new phone fast and this matched the price point of what i needed. It works well enough but the headphone jack stopped working less than a month after I got it, and to replace it I would have to send it to the company, which would take up to 2 weeks, which is why I got the phone in the first place, to avoid not having a phone any longer. I have had it since late November, and I don't think it will last much longer. The port to plug in a wall charger doesn't fit the charger well anymore, so I have to place it just in the perfect place or else it doesn't work. Being $150 when I bough it though, I shouldn't have expected much more out of it. still, definitely disappointed.
+	Simply put, this phone is amazing.  Slick operating system, great call quality, 4G, what more could you want?  Originally I thought I'd be buying this phone for a year or so and then "upgrage" to an I Phone or a Galaxy but after using this phone I am planning on using it until it no longer works.  If you know what you're buying and can survive without (1) a flash for the camera, (2) front facing camera and (3) some high-end games from the Windows Store, this phone is for you.  Battery life, call quality and web browsing are all great.  I've heard a lot of complaints that the app store doesn't have 5 million apps.  The app store has all the essentials and is growing every day.  Give this phone a chance, you'll be glad you did.  I have an android tablet and many of those "millions" of apps that everyone is missing are glitchy garbage, full of bugs, and make the operating system function like it's barfing.I am amazed at how many people are deducting stars for what they percieve to be "missing" features.  Do some research before buying a cell phone.  Also, many reviews preface their review with "For the price..."  For the price OR at $100 dollars more this is a great value.  Stop your whining!
-	have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible. Everything thing else works fine and unfortunately im stuck with it because the return window has expired. Phone is obviously defective so buyers beware
-	The title of this product says "Apple iPhone VERIZON" when in fact, it is an AT&T; phone.It would not let me activate this product for my verizon account because it had no simcard. That is when I realized that Verizon iPhones do not require a sim card. I proceededto look up how to activate it for Verizon and found out I can not because it is an AT&T;product. I am extremely disappointed and I am returning this. I expect a full refund.
+	Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used. Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android. But I'm happy with the phone.
+	When you see a smartphone available on the for $97, you might think that it would be something horrible that would fall apart after a month or it would be so slow and crashy that it would be unusable… unless it’s a Nokia Windows Phone. I went ahead and ordered the budget friendly Nokia Lumia 521 to see how it works. Not only is this Nokia Lumia 521 a really great deal, but there are a few things that actually put it above some of the higher end smartphones out there.SpecsThe Lumia 521 is basically a T-Mobile USA version of the Nokia Lumia 520 (which is now the best selling Windows Phone worldwide). It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 dual-core processor running at 1GHz with 512MB of RAM and 8 Gigs of internal storage. That’s not very much so you’ll have to pay attention to what apps you install. Fortunately, there is a MicroSD card slot that will allow you to add up to 64 Gigs of extra storage for music, videos, and photos.The 512 Megs of RAM is also a bit limiting as there are certain apps that you won’t be able to install. These include many high-end games as well as Zinio’s magazine reader for some reason.The phone’s size is 4.9 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches and weighs only 4.4 ounces. The 4 inch WVGA screen seems small by today’s standards, but that’s a good thing for one handed usage. In fact, the Lumia 521 is very well designed when it comes to one-handed ergonomics. The thickness and shape make the phone much more comfortable to hold than the extra large extra thin devices that are so popular. You can actually hold and use the Lumia 521 comfortably and that’s very refreshing to see.HardwareThe design of the Nokia Lumia 521 is not terribly impressive or innovative, but that’s not a bad thing. The plastic battery cover wraps all around to the front of the screen for extra drop protection. In fact, while the plastic certainly isn’t premium quality, the build quality feels very solid and rugged. Like most Nokia phones, it feels like it could take a fall and keep on going.At the top you’ve got the handset speaker along with some sensors, there is no front facing camera, but Skype will still work. You just have to point the rear camera into a bathroom mirror. Then you’ve got a 4 inch WVGA screen which isn’t very impressive. Outdoor visibility suffers a bit too, but it is still usable with gloves on. At the bottom are the usual Windows Phone capacities buttons for search, start screen, and back.On the right side there’s a series of plastic buttons protruding from the edge for activating the camera, power, and volume up or down. The buttons are easy to find with your fingers and they’ve got great tactile feedback.On the bottom there’s the micro USB port for charging and syncing.The left side has nothing but plastic.On the top is the 3.5-millimeter headset jack.On the back is the 5 megapixel camera and speaker hole. There is no flash so you’ll only want to use the camera outdoors with a good amount of light.nder the battery cover you’ll find the fairly common and very inexpensive-to-replace Nokia BL-5J 1430mAh battery, along with a Micro SIM card slot, and a Micro SD card slot where you can add up to 64Gb of extra storage for photos, videos, and music.While the Lumia 521 is pretty thick compared to other higher end phones, its smaller screen keeps it feeling just fine in the pocket.SoftwareMost of our Windows Phone 8 coverage can already be found in our full Windows Phone 8 review. That’s where you’ll get the most meat about the software on the Nokia Lumia 521, however we’ll look at a few highlights from both Nokia and T-Mobile here.I already mentioned how the RAM limitation may cause certain Windows Phone 8 apps to be incompatible with the Lumia 521, but there are also some interesting limitations to some of the Nokia apps. For example, the augmented reality view in Nokia’s HERE Maps app is not available, nor is City Lens and the augmented reality feature in the included Weather Channel app does not work.The phone does include Nokia’s HERE Drive free GPS navigation program though. The bad news is that the license only includes maps for the U.S.A., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. You’ll have to pay extra for other countries, but still the United States is pretty big. You need to have a T-Mobile US SIM card in the phone in order for HERE Drive to work, but it does not require an active rate plan to function.Another feature that’s probably worth the cost of the phone is the Nokia Music app. You can download up to 4 custom radio mixes for listening to offline. Then when you get tired of those, you can delete them and download 4 more. It’s unlimited offline music! The catch is you can’t rewind any songs. You have to listen to the whole playlist, though you can skip about 6 per hour. Still, that’s free music with no data plan!The only T-Mobile customization that’s really worth mentioning is the Wi-Fi calling feature. If you turn this on, you’ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth. You don’t need the cell towers outside at all to make calls. It’s a little unreliable though, so I would only turn this on when absolutely necessary.PerformanceThe Nokia Lumia 521 scored 169.25 in WPBench, compared to 234.73 on Lumia 928  or 232.11 for the Lumia 925. The Lumia 521′s score seems a lot lower than other Windows Phones and you would expect that for the price, but in normal usage everything is still buttery smooth. If you put the device side by side with a more expensive Windows Phone, you’ll certainly notice that the Lumia 521 does not perform as well. The screen doesn’t move quite as fast as the PureMotion HD displays of higher-end Nokia phones of course. Still, it’s quite usable and pleasant.Unfortunately and as usual, Xbox Music can still be frustratingly slow when using it with an Xbox Music Pass. It seems like every time you want to access some music in the store it has to go out on the internet to recheck your permissions for streaming/downloading. Furthermore, sometimes it doesn’t do the check properly and streaming doesn’t work. The Zune days were so much better for music on Windows Phone. Still, copying MP3s to your MicroSD card and playing them from there will work  just fine.Battery LifeIn terms of battery life, the Lumia 521 does quite well with average use. It’s certainly enough for a day and the device doesn’t have any terribly power hungry features like a high resolution screen or image stabilization. The key thing here is that the Lumia 521 has a removable BL-5J battery which is pretty common in older Nokia phones. You can get another one for about $4 and swap it out whenever.Call Quality/Network PerformanceVoice calls actually sound great on the Lumia 521. Even at 50% volume, the handset speaker is quite loud. Normally I have to increase the volume to 100% on other phones in order to hear the person on the other end. That’s not necessary with the 521.The Lumia 521 doesn’t support LTE, but it still works with T-Mobile’s 4G HSPA network, and for such a budget device like this, that’s plenty. If you’re in the market for this kind of phone you probably don’t want to pay a lot for internet access anyway, so a slower speed is really an advantage for keeping your monthly bill a bit lower.Pros+ Very inexpensive+ Removable, inexpensive, easy-to-find battery+ Micro SD card expansion for extra photos, videos, and music+ Comfortable ergonomic form factor & design+ Wi-Fi calling+ Nokia HERE Suite (Offline GPS navigation for USA = worth the price of the phone alone)+ Nokia Music (free unlimited offline music playlist downloads = worth the price of the phone alone)+ GDR2 and Nokia Amber updates have been pushed to the device as of 8/14Cons- No flash- only 8GB of storage available for apps- Low resolution screen with mediocre outdoor visibility- No compass for augmented reality apps- 512Mb RAM means some apps won’t run- No wireless charging option- Nokia HERE Drive license only supports USA, Peurto Rico, and US Virgin Islands (it’s not a global license.)
-	I love this phone, and couldn't see myself using any other phone as of writing this.  Its fast, sleek, the stylus is a must have feature for those who need to write things down while taking a phone call.  For starters I do not have any issues with my phone right now.  But I did purchase a OEM Samsung HDMI connector.  The device did not work. So I called Samsung USA.  I understand this is an International phone, but I bought it on Amazon in the USA.  It has the Samsung name it should be supported anywhere Samsung has tech support.  So I called Samsung USA, and they said I have to call Samsung UK.  As they have no knowledge of the international version.  So Samsung is saying they don't know their product if its an international version.  Ridiculous. That will cost me money calling long distance.  That is unacceptable.  I have recommended Samsung numerous times.  But this has changed my mind about recommending and or purchasing Samsung products in the future.
-	I found this phone hard to use. You get what you pay for. I am use to apple products which shine compared to this junk. Its not all Nokia s fault, its the crappy Microsoft software that comes with it too.  The number one app Excel is not compatible with windows mobile! You cant edit or update it. Just to get music and a camera besides the phone in my opinion isn't worth it. $79 is too much. This smartphone isn't very smart. Its hard to type on, the display is too sensitive, it launches applications when they are not suppose to, there is no way to input phone numbers for storage unless you go through the Microsoft people app which is long and boring. I could go on and on. Buy an apple, save yourself the anguish.
+	I got 2 phones one for me one for my 10 years old son ,we love it so much I'm planning to buy one more just in case
+	For the price you can't beat this phone. As long as your not tied into Google which I am but my sister isn't this is a great phone for such a low price.
+	This phone has amazing value.  For $150 total cost (when not on sale), you get a lot for your money!!  I give this 4/5 stars due to lack of front-facing camera, no flash, no bluetooth capability and weaker hardware (RAM and processor) than other Lumia models.  The Windows Phone OS is great.  Even though there are a lot less apps in the Windows Store, most of them are quality, not like Apple and Google that have many junk apps.  As a T-Mobile user, I feel this is the best Windows Phone available.  This model has a major advantage over the Lumia 925 because the 521 has expandable memory and the 925 does not.  If the 925 had expandable memory, it would be the perfect phone!
+	wp8 is much better operating system than android and phone is great for price. better than i expected it to be.
-	Purchased this phone from amazon back in December 2012. Initially no problems, the phone was working great, about couple months ago, when I switch cellular carries, I had to switch my sim card, and then nightmare with Samsung got started....For some reason, the phone was not reading my sim card. Initially I though, it is because of my new cellular phone carrier that the Samsung Galaxy Note II does not support, so no big deal, I can switch to another carries, however when I switch to another carrier, the phone again does not read the sim card. I though maybe the problem is simple and can be fixed without bothering Samsung Customer Service so I took it to certified repair shop and the repair shop told me that the the phone does not read the sim card and there is no way knowing why it does not read it and fixing the slot for the sim card is almost impossible as the sim card slot is integrated with the motherboard of the phone. The repair shop returned the phone back to me saying it is unfixiable. I though that the repair shop is not really experienced, anything can be repaired nowadays, so I am not worried. I took the phone to another repair shop and they said that the same thing as the first repair shop. If the phone does not read the sim card, the problem is very likely relate with the communication between sim card and the motherboard of the phone.After wasting a month or so with cellular phone repair shops, I called Samsung Customer Service. My phone was under warranty after all. It has been less then a year. Only couple months from the date of the purchase. Samsung Customer Service was very polite however said that they can not help me... I asked them why, and their answer was very puzzling. They told me that my phone is international unlock and it belongs to South Africa and I need to contact them to get it repair. I politely asked them to provide South Africa Samsung customer service phone number so I can contact them to send my phone to South Africa to get it fixed. They said they don't have their phone number but they will transfer my call to another customer service to see if I can get help. The phone did not go through...I called again....This time they transferred...I explained what happened again and new customer service rep told me that, I can not send my Samsung phone to South Africa either as they have no way of verifying if I am the original buyer. I was the original buyer from amazon.com. The product came was brand new.I tried to explain them, that this is Samsung phone and I paid close to $600, the phone is still under warranty. I would be careless if the phone came from a different country or planet, it is your phone and I need your support. They repeatedly told me that there is nothing can be done as this is an international unlock phone and USA customer service of Samsung does not support and they are unable to tell me which Samsung worldwide branch can support. Apparently calling Korea would not help me either as they said they won't help me. I literally begged them to show me a way to get this phone fixed. I can even pay for the fixing cost, but again they sincerely apologized for not being helpful. Later on, I tried different customer service rep by calling their USA number but each time I got pretty much same result and now I am trying to sell this phone on Craigslist as for parts.If phone works, no issues, I know it is a great phone however if somehow you experience the same problem as I did, do not expect any support from Samsung. For USA phones, maybe no problem to get support but international unlock Samsung Phones seems problematic to get support. Overall, if it the Samsung phone breaks down on you, you are on your own...
-	If you are needing this phone to work for at&t.; IT WILL NOT WORK! It will work on wifi but you can not use your data on it.
-	It's an AT&T; phone, and unfortunately, after many attempts at trying to get it to work, it would not connect to the network (it needed  a "SIM Network Unlock Pin". I called T-Mobile, my provider, who said I should go to AT&T; for the unlock code; then, AT&T; said they couldn't help me.I mean, the phone hardware (from Samsung) and seller (Moh) were both good, with no complaints - but my provider apparently can't help, and AT&T; has been less than helpful; thus, the phone remains a brick unless I can get an unlock key.
+	Went way beyond my expectations. Easy to work and takes really great pics. I am going to buy two more for Christmas presents.
+	I bought this phone to use it's "wi fi talk" on the T-Mobile network when I am abroad. I have never used a windows phone. It took me about 2 days to learn the "in's and out's" of it, and I found it super easy and nice to use.I regularly use my new Samsung Note 3.0 and I love it, and also use a galaxy S-4, and I have owned all the iPhones before moving on to the Android  system few months back ( and never looked back at the "I" thing....).This phone is not in the same league as my current galaxy S 4 or Note 3.0  but it is so easy to use and has the essential apps you would need. I can't complain at all. I use the monthly unlimited plan from T- mobile , for 50 dollars and it is  really good with 4G also in my area .I don't have regrets about this purchase, in fact I bought a second one for a friend.I am tempted to get the newer and bigger Nokia later,...Yes it is that nice of an O/S to use.I recommend it for casual user, it is fast and responsive, and you can add like me, a 32 Gb micro SD that holds tons of pics and music.Really not bad for the money..it feels Ok in the hand not cheap and easy to operate. the buttons are nicely placed on the side.. I bought a cover from amazon for 5 bucks as the phone tend to be a bit slippery in my hand.It does not have a flash, but it takes decent pics, nothing like the previous mentioned phones of course, but hey for 79 bucks with free shipping how can u complaints.I am so glad I stepped away from Apple products and discovered the android phones and now the windows phone. I feel the iPhone software and phone are so outdated and so ,proprietary,...Just IMHO. The windows software integrates very well with my desktop and it is so easy to update and add files from the desktop,..If you are on the fence about this phone, Go for it, you'll thank yourself later.
-	The phone is not ideal for anyone who likes the download games, music, text or email on their phones. But if ou just make and receive calls only, then the phone is perfect for you.
-	This phone itself is amazing and beautiful but because of some baseband restrictions  on the international version you can only get Edge(1g-2g) speeds on Tmobile's network which renders the phone pretty much useless. Steer clear if you plan on using this on T-mobile's gsm network. Also, on ATT you can only get 3g speeds. Forewarned. I wish I had known before I ordered one. Thankfully amazon's return policy rocks.
-	This phone does not work with Verizon! Did not say that any where in the description! What a pain this is.
-	The phone was purchased in June 2013.  In six months it was not taking a charge properly.  I assumed that my teenaged daughter was not being vigilant about properly recharging the phone.  It turns out there is a problem with the phone.I went to T-Mobile in February and they took $20 from me and arranged to have a new phone sent to me.  On receipt of the new phone, I was to switch out the battery, memory card, SIM and the back of the phone, returning the non-working phone to T-Mobile.  I did this.  Problem solved?  No, the battery still did not hold a charge.Soon after, I went to T-Mobile and was told to call Nokia customer care, which would send me a new battery free of charge.  I called Nokia, spent a few minutes on the phone, and was told a battery would be sent to me.  Then I waited.  We went on vacation out of the country.  We returned.  Still, no battery.April 11, 2014 I called Nokia customer care.  They have no record of my previous conversation, but promise to send me a new battery, which should reach me in a week of less.  This time I get a tracking number.  I wait a week -- no battery.  I wait longer -- no battery.April 22, 2014, around 11 a.m. EST,  I called Nokia customer care to ask about the battery.  I was told that the battery was not in stock.  The battery is made in Finland, but needs to be sent to Asia before it can be shipped to the U.S. and they just don't have the battery.  On April 11, 2014 the customer service representative checked to make sure the battery was in stock.  They could not tell me when the battery would be in stock.  Can I get a refund?  No.  What can I do?  The customer service representative said he the problem would be escalated and I would be contacted later in the day.Despite being told I would be contacted again, I was not contacted.April 28, 2014, today, I called Nokia customer care.  Yes, they have a record of the prior conversations.  No, the battery has not come back in stock.  No, they do not know when they will have the battery, but they will ship it to me when they get it.  Can they give me an idea of how long that might be?  No.  I asked if anyone tried to reach me by email or phone after the problem was escalated (which is what I was told would happen) and was told that they do not have any record of anyone at Nokia attempting to reach me by email or phone.If you buy a Nokia phone, don't expect any assistance from Nokia if you have a problem with the phone.
+	This is a terrific mobile device at any price. The fact that it was HALF the price for a brand new device as any of the local stores makes it a bonus. We're very happy with this purchase. It was delivered a day early and is a nifty, streamlined Windows 8 phone. My son loves it. Thank you.
+	Love this phone, especially first time users of smart phones. Quick and snappy and has all the features ever needed on a device like this. Get a case on top of it then your good to go! I have a lot of fun wit it and the price is something you cannot beat especially if your on a budget. Sexy phone to boot :)
+	So I'm a T-Mobile convert and wanted to test the waters of the network without a large capital commitment and let me tell you this little phone is surprising.Only downside is the Windows App store limitations, which is nothing against the actual functionality of this phone. Turn off background apps and this thing runs a while!The phone is little (the 4 inches of screen is very narrow) but the touch sensitivity is great.Also, I had never used Windows Phone OS before and it is zippy. You look at the specs of this phone and think it's going to be sluggish, but the interface and launching apps is very fast. *** That being said, if you are used to Android or iOS then you will be disappointed. There are a lot of apps that I truly love on those (Plume, Flipboard, Cartwheel, Dunkin Donuts Pay, Starbucks Pay, Snip Snap) that are not available on Windows. That might not be a big deal for people newly getting into smartphones, but now that I know what's out there, it is hard to be satisfied with less.The screen resolution is poor compared to high end phones, but due to the smaller screen size it is not unbearable to look at by any means.I love how all of the battery saving options are made very clear and background apps are identified so you don't overdrain your battery. That said, if you use your phone heavily, the battery can drain aggressively when doing various functions, but it also warns you when the battery drops significantly in a short period, so if you know you won't be near an outlet soon, you can change your usage habits.Also, the Nokia Offline Music and Here Maps are crazy! Download some stuff while you're online then you can have access to GPS Maps and music offline for FREE!?!?!I honestly bought it because I knew at the very least I get a $70 GPS/MP3 player that has Wifi capability and can be a back up phone if I need.Shocked, surprised, impressive, all for the price point.You have to know what you're getting into and I'm a pretty big tech nerd (I used to have a Google Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and right now this thing performs faster and is less glitchy.Battery life is also acceptable. Read the Microsoft tips page on the website for battery saving and don't use it 24/7 and you can get most likely get a full day out of it, provided you aren't constantly downloading/watching stuff.Anyone who is hesitant about Windows phones or T-Mobiles network this is THE start phone to get.Let me know if you have questions, but considering I was running a high end phone before and still like this little guy (a lot) it's hard to go wrong at the price with T-Mobiles $30 unlimited data and text plan, it makes it a smartphone you can actually use all the time as a smartphone.
-	BATTERY NEVER HELD CHARGE. SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS WAS A KNOCK OFF OF THE REAL THING. RETURNED PHONE PER THE INSTRUCTIONS, NOTHING IN RETURN. SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND NOTHING FROM AMAZON
-	This seller is a scammer. Well offers Galaxy note GT N7100 2 And upon receiving the phone is another reference which does not help. And he refuses to answer. It's not a star deserves.
-	I guess I'd be defensive too if someone asked me why I sold them a defective phone. Bought this phone as a backup, and admittedly, did not start using it until AFTER the 30 day warranty period. I start using it, and it's totally freaking buggy. Will not consistently connect to the wireless network.Somehow that's my problem and I'm the jerk for asking for a refund after the warranty period. Excuse me.Thanks a lot buddy. Don't buy anything from this person.
-	This is the worst phone on the market. It Can't hold a charge and very hard to hear.The Voice is garbeled, and just not good.I had a Samsung before and should have stayed with it.
-	The phone was very pretty and stylish but only stayed on about  10 min. I had to go thru the hassle of returning the phone and waiting  on another kind. I was very disappointed.
-	This was my first smartphone bought in July 2013 and kept it for 6 months, but I wanted to upgrade immediately from the day I set it up.  It's an older, bottom-end phone, and I strongly recommend that you look for something better.  Straight Talk phone service was GREAT in SF Bay Area at $45/mth, but I've upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy 3 and switch to T-Mobile's $30 month for 5GB of 4G data and unlimited text, but only 100 talk minutes (which is perfect for me).  Don't waste your money on this old Centura!!!
-	I bought two of these, one to replace my old Sony Ericsson W580i and one to replace my mother's older Pantech Breeze.  I figured soon there would be no non-smartphones to buy for an AT&T; plan and thought this would be a good time to update our simple non-smartphones.  My mother loved the original Pantech Breeze (in white), but didn't like this one despite its similarity.  I hate it.My hearing is not that bad, but I am getting older and I find I need to turn up the volume over the years.  This Pantech Breeze II has very low volume and I could barely hear callers even with the volume turned all the way up.  Answering the phone is a nightmare because of the prominently placed volume rocker buttons on the left.  I would hit those blasted buttons and either put the phone into silent mode, accidentally hang up on the caller, or reduce the headset volume to nearly zero every time I opened the flip to answer the phone.It is almost impossible to call a person from your contact list in less than four button pushes.  What is up with that ?  How can you make it so hard to call someone ?  Isn't that what a cell phone is used for ?  Did I mention I hate this phone ?  I am a geekette and don't have any problem modifying a phone to fit my needs and can usually adjust to most menu approaches on phones.  The Pantech Breeze II seems to make a challenge out of seeing how many button pushes it can make you do to do the simplest of tasks.I finally killed the phone, much to my relief.  I slipped this phone next to my skin under some clothing while I walked the dogs and I was expecting an important call.  Some phones are more sensitive than others to moisture, and this one is a complete sissy when it comes to moisture.  Sure enough the little white dots under the battery cover were bright pink after a 10 minute walk. So I ruined the phone within two weeks.  I had done this with my Sony Ericsson with no issues for YEARS.  Yes, it was my fault, so I am not blaming Pantech, and my mother gladly gave me her Pantech Breeze II which I used for a few months until I absolutely couldn't stand it anymore.I went back to my old Sony Ericsson W580i.  Now I am obligated to two more years of AT&T; less than great service which stinks.  Worst thing I could have done since I was off contract for years prior to this.  I should have shopped around for some unlocked GSM phones.Don't waste your time with this Pantech Breeze II.  Really, you will be sorry.
+	they were a quick shipper and the product was as described.  the price was far and I would recommend them to my friends
-	I have changed this cellphone TWICW already! I have no idea why they still selling it! Piece of junk no
-	I buy a unlocked phone and the phone was not unlocked I was so mad because I buy it to send it to my country and I brother say it is not unlocked I am so mad about it
-	Do not buy phones from Pure Mobility, I ordered the I phone from them, it said unlocked and when I received it, the phone was locked. I tried talking to them they wanted to charge me $54 buck plus shipping to return the phone, what a rip off. Please be sure to check the company you are buying from, check the BBB. Pure Mobility customer service was the worst I have ever dealt with.
+	I am a no- contract user. I pay $50 a mo for unltd text, data, calls... I use wi-fi when possible and it stays at 4G...I wanted to get the new IPhone 5... Even went in to TMoble to handle one. I liked it and was on the fence. Realized it would cost me an extra $40-$50 a month on top of the plan itself...I saw the reviews and thought id give this a shot and i am SO happy i didn't get the iPhone!! This phone is awesome. it is fast, i can navigate through it easily, the apps are kina lame, but that's ok!!! it is totaly worth $100... I hope it lasts me a long time, and if for some reason it doesn't, i will stick to the window's phone, specifically the Nokia Lumina series. I recommend this phone!
+	While my wife and daughter are using iPhones, I had been refusing spending $300~$600+ for a phone as I am not a heavy cell phone user, until last week I found this Nokia 521 deal was too hard to pass. For $69, this clearly is the best smart phone deal out there and I found it is more than I need for a smart phone (in a good way)! As I am not a gamer, I only use the phone for phone calls, text messaging, checking emails and browsing the web while not near my PC, and taking casual photos while my camera is not around. Here are the features I really like about this phone that other smart phones may or may not have:1. Pretty fast Snapdragon processor.2. Windows Phone 8 OS is easy to learn and operate.3. Replaceable battery....not too many newer phones has that nowadays.4. SD card slot for additional storage....again, not too many newer phones has that.5. SkyDrive for even more storage....free 7G space.6. Optional Voice-texting....don't need to use the tiny keyboard on screen if you don't want to.7. I especially like this feature: I can put all of my favorite contact person's names/pictures on "Start Page" as "small tiles" and they would work as a speed-dial short-cut for phone calls/texting.....I don't need to look for the person in a phonebook that can be frustrating sometimes.....good for people who has poor eyesight.8. "HERE" drive and maps can work as offline GPS....I have not tried them as yet.9. Like an iPhone, I can hand-write (as an input method) Chinese with emails, etc.10. There are many other features that I probably won't be using too often and you may have read in other reviews.In general, I don't really think there is any phone (new or used) has such value on the market today....it doesn't have the built-quality as an iPhone but, it is also 8~10 times less expensive too! The only downside for me is that it's locked with T-Mobile only and I'm not sure T-Mobile will unlock this phone or not in the future. I think most people, who are not heavy phone users like me, would be very pleased with 521!**************************************Update: After another week of using the phone, I still feel the same about 521......I think Windows Phone 8 OS really has plenty of features that most people would be very pleased with it. Sometimes, I feel it may give me too much information than I really need.....like, once I setup my Facebook account with the phone, I will automatically receive all the Facebook updates & feeds on the phone that sometimes may just be a little too much info for me on a phone. Also, sometimes when I delete emails (Verizon.net) on the phone, they would automatically be deleted from my Verizon email server also.....so, I may not be able to view the emails on my other PC if it is turned on after the emails are deleted from the phone first. It happens sometimes but not always.....I really could not figure out why because the phone email setup does not have an option for something like "leave an email copy on the server" to check.... Guess I just have to be careful about deleting emails on the phone.Other than these new minor findings, I still feel the phone is the best value on the market!
-	So 2 months ago I buy this awesome phone, then my soft key LED's stop working and the touch screen has a dead spot, so I figure I'll just send it back and they'll fix it.  NOPE.  I send it to them, it's gone a little over a week, I get it back still broken, and now it has a awesome spot in the battery compartment that's missing paint that Samsung chipped off apparently during disassembly when they were 'providing customer service'.  They say its 'BER'. 'Beyond Economical Repair',  'GROSS ELECTROMECH DAMAGE-ABUSE'.  HUH?!?  Really?  It also says there was a 'pad lifted' inside, I'm guessing they're talking about a solder pad on the board.  This all from a new phone that was always in a case and never dropped or 'abused'.  My only guess is that it was messed up when it left the factory or during shipping, or during some fool at Samsung prying at the board (they did in fact chip the paint!  So I think that's totally possible), then it failed on me, and Samsung blames me for their manufacturing mistakes.  I watched the guy at the store open this device new and unpackage it, so it was not them.  Wow, great customer service.  Just do a Google search "Samsung bad service" and you'll see that I'm not the only one.  Buyer beware, Samsung refuses to help their customers.  Even Apple admits to their manufacturing flaws; dented phones, scratched screens reversed buttons, dead pixels...  but Samsung?  Nope, you, Mr. Customer, you broke it, and there's no way you can prove otherwise!  BER? It should be BPR, Beyond Profitable Repair.  This was the first and last time that I will EVER buy a Samsung anything.  On top of it all they totally voided my warranty, not like they had any intention of honoring it.  I'm also filing complaints with the state attorney generals office and the better business bureau.  Apple may have their downfalls with the junk iTunes and limitation of their devices, but I may just go back...
-	Cheap screen, had the protective cover on, had the phone for only 2 hours, went to place it on table and the screen cracked. The phone is nice but the build and quality is ZERO. Do not buy.
+	the Nokia Lumia 521 had a lot more features than I was expecting;  Takes excellent photos;  Love the speaker quality, I listen to a lot of music.  Overall extremely satisfied.
-	I put two different sim cards in the phone and the phone still dont work. The phone does not have 3G bars are nothing it always have the letter E for Error. Amazon stated that it was brand new but it could be refurbished.
+	Easy to use especially since it is Windows 8 based. Since my computer is Win8 it made learning the Nokia much easier. I love it!
