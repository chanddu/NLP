That was done in the second movie.
She's poised and amazing.
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).
And it was boring.
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.
I am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.
Why was this film made?
Excellent short film.
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.
